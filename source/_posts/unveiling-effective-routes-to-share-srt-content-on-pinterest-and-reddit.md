## Unveiling Effective Routes to Share SRT Content on Pinterest & Reddit

If you're a content creator, then you should know the importance of adding subtitles to your videos.

Today, a lot of social media users, especially on Facebook, tend to watch videos without turning on the sounds. But the big question is 'If your audience doesn't turn on the sound of your videos, how do they get the message you're trying to pass?" Well, this is why adding 'Subtitles' to your videos is crucial. However, for a subtitle to work, it needs to comply with the structure of a video player or any platform you intend to use it on. And fortunately, SRT is a universal format, making it usable on any social media platform.

In this guide, you'll be introduced to the simple methods you can utilize to upload SRT files to social media platforms including YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, etc. But before we proceed, let's take a look at an overview of the different social media platforms and the subtitle file formats they support.

| Social Media Platform | SRT | VTT | STL | SSA |
| --------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YouTube               |     |     |     |     |
| Twitter               |     |     |     |     |
| Facebook              |     |     |     |     |
| Instagram             |     |     |     |     |
| Vimeo                 |     |     |     |     |
| LinkedIn              |     |     |     |     |

From the overview table above, it's obvious you can easily create one SRT file and easily use it on different social media channels. This saves you the stress of creating different subtitle files for each platform. So, without further ado, let's dive in to find out how to upload and add .srt files to different social media platforms.

## Part 1: Upload SRT Files to YouTube Videos

If you're a YouTube video content creator, but you still don't know the benefit of adding subtitles to your videos, let's give you the top two main hints on how subtitles affect your videos;

* Subtitles help your videos to be understood not only by folks who hear and see but also by folks who have hearing problems. Hence helping your video to reach more audience.
* You need subtitles to make your videos SEO rich as phrases in your subtitle can be used as keywords by Google when users search for stuff related to your video online.

That being said, keep in mind that SRT subtitles and CC are two different things. Although they are often used interchangeably, they are both distinct. The only similarity CC and SRT share is that they're text version of the audio aspect of videos.

CC, also known as Close Caption the words spoken in the video, and it allows viewers understand the information being passed in a video without necessarily turning on the volume.

SRT subtitles, on the other hand, are translations of the word that's spoken in a video. For example, if you're streaming Korean movie, but you don't understand the language, you'd need a translation of the dialogue at the bottom of your screen. The English translation that's displayed on your screen is known as the SRT subtitles.

Now you know how subtitles affect your videos, and what the difference between SRT and CC are, let's proceed to learn how to upload SRT files to YouTube videos.

Step1Sign in to your YouTube channel and locate the 'YouTube Creator Studio'. Then select 'Subtitles' on the right menu.
