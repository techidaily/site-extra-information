If you find it challenging to capture a great quality HDR image, following tips may help you.

### Choose Low ISO Setting

![iso setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-12.jpg)

HDR photography creates noise and makes images appear grainy. To fix this, you can go for low ISO setting to ensure less noise.

### Choose Continuous Mode

![continuous mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-13.jpg)

For shooting, choose continuous mode becasue it’ll require you to take bracketed photos only by clicking the release button once. This option is available in Canon and Nikon cameras.

### Go for a Cable Release

![cable release](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-14.jpg)

When you press the release button, chances of camera shaking or movement are high. You can try preventing it by using a cable release.

### Opt for Several Brackets

![brackets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-15.jpg)

You’ll have several options in post processing if you go for more brackets. For example, going for nine exposures will help you get a better looking image result than opting for two exposures.

### Focus on Aperture Priority Mode

![aperture priority mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-16.jpg)

This mode influences the way your camera see field depth. When you keep your aperture fixed for all photos, it’ll prevent changes in depth field. When not fixed, these changes can ruin the image.

### Get yourself a Tripod

Although it isn’t a necessity, a tripod will help you in nighttime HDR shooting. Or, it might help you take great quality daytime photos, too.

## Part 5: Take your HDR Camera and Shoot the Best HDR Photos

Have you seen mesmerizing sunsets? The captivating contrasts of yellow and red colors, doesn’t it look like the most beautiful view? That’s where you must try HDR photography. Even the time of sunrise seems like the best time to capture a stunning HDR image.

Apart from this, HDR technique can be used to shoot nightscapes and interirors. You can try it in the scenes with a lot of contrast. However, avoid HDR technique with a moving subject.

Next time, when you experiment with landscape or architectural photography, turn on the HDR mode and see the difference yourself.

## Final Words

HDR photography has fans and foes. But this shouldn’t restrict you from trying it. Like other photography types, you need practice and patience to ace it.

And with the help of best camera, right set up, tip and tricks mentioned in this blog, you’re sure to nail HDR photography style.

It’s equally important to be aware of scenes or scenario where HDR photography works best. Therefore, try capturing dramatic skies or fields with high color contrast in HDR mode in camera and see the magic yourself.
