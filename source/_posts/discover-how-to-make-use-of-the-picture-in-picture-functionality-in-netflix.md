## Part 1\. How to Enable Picture-in-Picture on Netflix on Desktop

### PiP on Mac

Mac differs from Windows in the sense that it doesn't have an actual app for Netflix. Instead, you can watch your videos by using the web browser.

The picture-in-picture feature is available if you are using the Google Chrome browser. If you're using a Linux or Windows computer, you can also work with the following method.

1. First, launch **Google Chrome** on your device.
1. Open [**com**](https://www.netflix.com/) and select a movie or show.
1. Once the video is played, click the **media control button**. This can be found in the top right corner of the Chrome window.
1. Upon clicking it, a popup window will appear. Select the **"Picture in Picture" button**, positioned at the bottom right corner.
