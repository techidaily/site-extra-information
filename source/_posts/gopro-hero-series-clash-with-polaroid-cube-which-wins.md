#### 5.Video and Image Quality

 Cube+ device offers 3 major choices for resolution: 720P, 1080P and 1440P. You can follow 60fps and 30fps frame rate with 1080p and 720p resolution whereas slow motion mode can be switched with 720p and 120fps. For taking stills you can easily switch between 3MP, 6Mp and 8MP where automatic exposure effect leads to much impressive results in daylight. But in case of low light performance you may feel little disappointed. The image stabilization feature is a better addition for video modes.

 There is no doubt to say that photo and video mode of Hero Session are impressive with outstanding audio quality. You can switch between various videos modes as: 1440p with 25/30 fps, 1080p with 25/30/48/50/60fps, 960 with 25/30/50/60 fps and 720p at 25/30/50/60 and 100fps. You can also grab amazing results for slow motion recording with 120fps and 100 fps frame rate but preferably switch to 720 at 100fps to get good results. Users are also able to enjoy ProTune feature along with auto low light mode. You can boost its audio with two microphones but it cannot work with external ones.
