## Deep Review of Pot Player

### 1\. Adding Files and Managing Playlists

 Users can add various files, even a complete directory to POT player library and allow it to play high quality content from URLs directly. The key board shortcuts make playlist editing much easier whereas drag and drop features are more beginners friendly.

 The playlist tabs are well designed where users can manage numerous albums; all added controls are later automatically saved to playlists and they are auto loaded for the next time. Albums on its library are managed in alphabetical order and your can also add files from one album to another using add and edit menu. Note that, the drag and drop feature works only within playlists, they cannot work inside a playlist.

### 2\. Playing Audio Files

 When you are ready to enjoy playbacks then it is also possible to pair up content with equalizers in order to have rich sound quality. When this paired up connection is dragged into timeline, they work in perfect synchronism and if you want to separate them at any moment then simply drag the playlist.

 On the bottom right side of the playback screen, you will find three buttons. If you left click on the first one then it will open windows folder containing controls for current playback, extensive menu can be opened with right click to this first button. The middle one is designed to close or launch the control panel if you follow the left click whereas right click will simply open skin menu. The last or right most button is designed to open or close the playlist.

 Users can manage audio equalizer adjustments from control panel and it can also provide services for easy settings of video frames, video ratios, play settings, control subtitles, screen captures and other video settings.

### 3\. Playing Video Files

 Generally, the video frame appears on left portion of screen and right one stays cluttered with playlist but you can simply close it by pressing the little arrow head on right most corner of screen. In order to bring video to the full screen mode, you need to double click over it. Return back to small window by pressing Esc or double click again.

 It is also possible to hide skin during video playbacks and users can easily hover over different elements on screen. The video playback menu of Pot Player is quite useful and it allows users to manage channel controls. NV12 offers controls for specific frames, within subtitles, frame by frame movements within videos. The first three control buttons on bottom screen works for video processing, subtitles and stream controls. If you want to access advanced control menu then simply right click over control panel button and soon you will be able to manage so many advanced controls for your player.
