## How to Soften Your iPhone Pics: A Detailed Breakdown (4 Ways)

Swipe-drag the modes present above the **Shutter** button to switch to the **PORTRAIT** option, and tap the main subject on the screen that you want to capture the image of.

Next, use two fingers to drag inwards or outwards on the screen to decrease or increase the effective area respectively.

**Step 4: Blur the Photo and Export**

From the top, ensure that the **Blur Strength** option is selected, tap anywhere on the screen, and drag to the right to increase the intensity of the blurriness. Optionally, you can tap the Effect Types icon from the bottom, and tap to choose **Vignette Strength** from the box that comes up.

Then, as earlier, drag your finger to the right or left anywhere on the screen to increase or decrease the intensity of the effect respectively. Once done, tap the **OK** button (with the tick mark) from the bottom-right corner. Back on the main screen, tap **EXPORT** from the bottom-right, you tap your preferred option for exporting.

**Conclusion**

Blurring the background in a photo ensures that the main subject remains in the focus, and all the other unimportant objects don’t steal the limelight. If you are using iPhone 7 Plus or above models, the background of the photos can be blurred at the time of capturing. Furthermore, the built-in Photos app in iPhones also come with the Vignette effect that enables you to do the job with ease. However, if you want precision and more control over the images while blurring, you can use an efficient third-party tool like Snapseed that also has its own set of tutorials to teach **how to blur a picture on iPhone**.
