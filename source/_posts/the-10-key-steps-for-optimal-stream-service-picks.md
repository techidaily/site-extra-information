 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

 You can easily find so many live streaming platforms over internet such as YouTube Live, Facebook Live, Ustream, Livestream etc but the selection of right one as per requirements of users is really an difficult task. If you are a beginner and finding trouble in your selection process then the article below will help you to narrow down your list of preferences. There is no need to pay for features that you don’t even want to use, simple pick the suitable and useful tools for your needs and enjoy your live streams with friends.

## Consider the CDN

 Here, CDN is an abbreviation for Content Delivery Network.

### Speed Matters

 When we talk about video streaming then speed plays major role. Size of video files use to be much larger as compared to other data files so they demand faster internet connection for transfers otherwise you may face an error. Now as during live streaming process, data is transmitted on real time basis so users cannot recover the losses in between. Direct video streaming from a server is easier only when you have to focus upon localized area or small number of viewers.

### CDNs offer reliability and speed

 This speed issue is well treated by CDNs. Actually, CDN acts like a global network where all servers are linked together. During CDN based streaming, the data is automatically copied and transferred over all available servers. All viewers will be able to access videos from servers that appear closest to their location. Hence, overall speed gets maximized and the buffering issue is eliminated. With the distributed CDN network, it becomes possible to share huge load over server and millions of viewers can stay tuned at a time.
