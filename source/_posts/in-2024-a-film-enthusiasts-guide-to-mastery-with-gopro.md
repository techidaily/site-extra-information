Hence to create impressive videos, it is good to follow few expert tips and tricks.

## Tips and Tricks for GoPro

#### 1.Settings

 You can leave most of the GoPro settings on Auto mode so that your action camera can manage brainy stuff during recording. If you want to follow the customized settings then it is better to go ahead with low light settings or white balance etc. Depending upon your footage needs, you can vary the resolution levels between WVGA and 4K whereas the perfect middle ground for all your needs is 1080p level. With few basic settings for brightness and exposure you can easily develop rich footage.

#### 2.Choose the Right [GoPro Mounts:](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Most of GoPro devices come with mounts in their boxes whereas you can also buy them as additional accessories.

#### 3.Try Protune

#### 4.Change Perspective

 The GoPro action cameras are well known for wide angle lenses but it doesn’t mean that you must keep on shooting all videos with 170 degree FOV. It is better to switch between different field of angles at different time instants as per need of your footage. You can switch to 90 degree that is narrow view whereas 127 degrees is rated as a medium view. The narrower settings help users to get more focused look of action or in other words it works somewhat like zooming in. You can find FOV settings on the screen itself under main video settings.

#### 5.Use [Timelapse Mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

It is not essential to stick to the slow motion mode all the time rather you can do more adventurous things with your camera. The time lapse mode selection is available over on-board settings and it assists users in capturing individual photos.

#### 6.Make use of fisheye lens
