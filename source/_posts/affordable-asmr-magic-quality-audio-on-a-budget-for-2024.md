Sennheiser is another professional microphone committed to capturing quality ASMR recordings. Although very costly, this microphone holds several incredible features that make it worth your investment. Sennheiser MKH416 has a built-in laser beam focus- a feature that lets the mic capture only your voice and rejects every other ambient sound. Connecting Sennheiser to an audio recording source requires an XLR cable and a phantom power source. This voice aid offers great services.

## Part 2\. What Else Do You Need to Make Good ASMR Videos?

1. Blowing sounds
2. Gentle whispering
3. Scratching

9. Chewing
10. Water drops
