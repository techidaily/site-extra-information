This is the types of camera shot that is photographed from the back, or shoulder to be precise of another person.

The subject to be highlighted is kept at somewhere between medium to close-up shot. These types of camera shots are perfect when you want your audience to notice the reactions of the subject during a conversation.

Also, the subject in these shots, faces the camera making their neck and shoulder viewable on the frame.

### 13\. Cut-In

This shot typically cuts the screen into two or three or sometimes four parts.

It is helpful when you have multiple things to be shown as important in one scene. It takes close-up of the thing that you want to show your viewer.

### 14\. Master Shot

A shot that is recorded from a single angle and is an uninterrupted shot to bring all the characters in view is referred to as the [master shot](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

It is basically the complete dramatized shot and can be edited together with other additional shots.

Also, this type of shot can be considered as the only shot to be used by a director for covering the scene. It can be a closer shot, full or long shot.

### 15\. Point of View Shot

POV or Point of View is a shot that focuses on what a character is trying to see in a scene.

The beauty of this type of shot is that the audience gets the picture of what’s going on in the character’s head.

For example, looking through the binoculars and shooting only where the character is seeing.
