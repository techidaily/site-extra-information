## Crafting Captivating Chronicles: A Guide to Storytelling Schools (#1-#8)

**_To be a good storyteller, you need to have the right coaching._**

![storyteller academy overview picture](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/best-academy-for-storytelling-1.jpg)

The art of storytelling is so crucial to your success that you can't neglect its shortcomings. Whether you're landing a new job or creating content that inspires people, a good story can truly transform your output. Unfortunately, learning this process can take quite a bit of time as resources to understand it are not that readily available.

However, there are some great online academies that could bring your storytelling to a whole new level. Today we are going to go through some of the popular ones so, in the end, you can decide which storyteller academy to enroll in. Each of them tackles storytelling in its own way, so you always have an option.

So, without wasting much time, let's get straight into the topic!

## Part I. Does Storytelling Matter?

The most important soft skill a person could have in his life is storytelling. If you could include amazing stories in your discussion, then no matter in the field, your words will connect and even, in many cases, inspire others. These days our attention is divided into many forms, so it is not always easy to share ideas or influence others. However, if you know how to tell stories, then people will listen.

Let's suppose that you're informing your friends or family members about a hike that you did last summer. In this case, if you only told them about the raw details, then it's more likely that they won't be much interested.

When you put this information in a story's context and apply its rules 9/10 times, your details will be more engaging. So, yes, storytelling is a game-changer in any situation.

## Part II. The (8) Best Academies to Become a Storyteller
