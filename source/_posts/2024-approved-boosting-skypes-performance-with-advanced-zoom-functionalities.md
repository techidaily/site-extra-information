### Does Zoom work with Skype?

You may now zoom inside of Skype. Although it may be hard to read, we're not referring to a competing application.

Skype was created to make it possible for individuals to interact with one another for free, no matter where they are.

You may now join a call on Skype as a guest, eliminating the need to register for an account. Zoom, on the other hand, is a more recent invention. The 2013 debut of the cloud-based video conferencing application has witnessed a significant surge in use. According to Skype, because the meeting links have no expiry date, you may make them in advance and invite participants at any moment. Whether you started the call or are only a participant, you may start it as long as you have the link. Once you have a link, you may use it whenever you wish to join the conversation. Links can be used again in the future.
