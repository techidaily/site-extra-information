VoiceX worked well for the most part. It sounded natural, and there was very little lag. However, we did encounter some issues with the extension crashing on occasion. Overall, we were impressed with VoiceX and would recommend it to anyone looking for a **voice changer for Chromebook**.

 Pros

* Easy to use
* Works for any browser app you can talk in
* Real-time voice changer
