## Part I. 4 tips to help you choose a live-streaming background

### 1\. Pure color background

You can choose any clean and solid color wall, curtain, or wallpaper as a background for your live stream. But make sure that it is neat enough and has a broad field of vision. Moreover, there is no exposure to it.

It will be best to choose one that can easily match any color. But remember, do not use pure white backgrounds as they are too reflective, which is not suitable for the vision of your stream as it affects the highlight of the streamer and the products very much.
