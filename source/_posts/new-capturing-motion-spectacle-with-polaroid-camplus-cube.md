With this fixed and limited power source it becomes difficult to get services for long hour usage.

 The camera can accept MicroSD card up to maximum capacity of 128GB and you can easily add MicroSDXC and MicroSDHC cards to this unit. As videos are heavily compressed with JPG type compression technology so, there is no need for any fixed MicroSD card speed limit.
