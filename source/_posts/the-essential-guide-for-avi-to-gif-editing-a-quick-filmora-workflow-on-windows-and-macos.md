## The Essential Guide for AVI-to-GIF Editing: A Quick Filmora Workflow on Windows & macOS

People enjoy watching and sharing longer videos, but in size, they are usually bigger. So, changing the format such as **AVI to GIF** can be one of the solutions.

So, people opt for top apps to convert AVIs to the compressed GIF. With many tools present now, like [Wondershare Filmora 11](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), the avi-to-gif shifting can be done in just steps only.

## Part 2: Comparison Between AVI and GIF

Given that AVI (Audio Visual Interleave) is a video-based format and GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is an image-centric file type, there are considerable differences between both.

AVI is a Windows and proprietary type of multi-media container format created by a team of developers at Microsoft. On the other hand, a GIF is a type of bitmap image file format, created under a CompuServe team with Steve Wilhite, a capable computer scientist from the United States, at the helm of the project.

So, in essence, both are vastly different, but have commonalities in certain aspects. For AVI to GIF conversion, knowing what they are should help.

| **Variable Frame Rate**           | GIFs calculate delay render duration per frame, and they run in milliseconds. All frames can include varying durations. So, a specific frame rate is difficult to confirm.           | Not supported- AVIs have a constant design.                                                                                                            |

### 1\. How to Merge Multiple AVI Videos to GIF Online?

Like using software to **convert AVI to GIF**, you can use specific online conversion tools to merge many GIF files to AVI. The Filmora software is highly capable of merging **AVI to GIF** files as well, but it is not accessible as an online tool.

### 2\. What is the maximum size of a GIF file?

The size of the GIF file is generally very small, and it depends on the particular resolution of the GIF file. Technically, the GIFs are limited to 100MB, although we recommend 8MB or less. Also, the source video resolution should be 720p max, but 480p we be better to go.

### 3\. Can you add sound to a GIF? If so, how?

Yes, one can add audio into GIF files with specific tools or software, but only if you convert it to a video file format. While using Filmora to **convert** **AVI to GIF**, you can add voiceover/recording or convert GIF to video format.

## Part 2: Comparison Between AVI and GIF

Given that AVI (Audio Visual Interleave) is a video-based format and GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is an image-centric file type, there are considerable differences between both.

AVI is a Windows and proprietary type of multi-media container format created by a team of developers at Microsoft. On the other hand, a GIF is a type of bitmap image file format, created under a CompuServe team with Steve Wilhite, a capable computer scientist from the United States, at the helm of the project.

So, in essence, both are vastly different, but have commonalities in certain aspects. For AVI to GIF conversion, knowing what they are should help.

### 2\. What is the maximum size of a GIF file?

The size of the GIF file is generally very small, and it depends on the particular resolution of the GIF file. Technically, the GIFs are limited to 100MB, although we recommend 8MB or less. Also, the source video resolution should be 720p max, but 480p we be better to go.

### 3\. Can you add sound to a GIF? If so, how?

Yes, one can add audio into GIF files with specific tools or software, but only if you convert it to a video file format. While using Filmora to **convert** **AVI to GIF**, you can add voiceover/recording or convert GIF to video format.
