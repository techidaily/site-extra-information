## Part 1\. 5 ways to overlay photos online

### 1\. [Online Image Editor](https://www.online-image-editor.com/)

Online Image Editor is a free online tool that makes the image overlay operation easy to do. Moreover, this website does not put any limit on the number of images or photos to be superimposed, even if the only way to do it is to overlap them one at a time, and not altogether. In practice, Online Image Editor works literally in layers, with the next image that overlaps with the previous one, and so on. To underline the fact that the images should not necessarily be superimposed, but also juxtaposed to one another on the same background, or rotated, or with various background effects such as shadows.
