### Watch Video: 10 Best Winter Olympics Highlight Moment \[2022\]

## Part 2\. Create a Video to Save the Highlights of Snowboard Cross

When you check out high-quality snowboard cross highlights videos online, you will find that there are certain elements that are common across all such videos. Starting from video effects and video editing to audio additions, here are all the common features used in snowboard cross highlights.

Pan and Zoom - You will see that still photos are slowly zooming and finally focusing on the main athlete in a group competition. This effect is called pan and zoom effect and it is currently the trending feature in a highlight video with still footage.

Transition - Transition effects are the most commonly used effects in a highlight video where still photos are used continuously. The transition effects make shifting from one photo to another smooth and eye-pleasing. The video editor you choose to make your highlight video should have ample number of transition effects.

Slow Motion - You need to have slow motion effect on your snowboard cross finals. This is because you will have to allow your viewers to check out the video footages comfortably to understand the best moments. There is no doubt that video footages are the main selling point in a highlight video and therefore, you have to give enough time on the clips that you collect from social media platforms.

Motion Tracking - Motion tracking could be the x-factor in any sports event highlight video. Motion tracking is highlighting a particular athlete such as the winner throughout a video clip so that the viewers could understand who the winner is and how he performed. You can highlight the athlete through motion tracking by attaching arrow, text, clipart and likewise.

Texts and Voiceover - Most highlight videos show titles and texts over the still photos of the event so that the viewers can understand the highlights and moments easily. The titles and texts are shown with animation for better traction. However, there are many professional video creators who prefer voiceover instead of showing texts as voiceover gives a life to the video.
