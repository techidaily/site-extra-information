![select export media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/fix-for-exporting-srt-file-from-premiere-1.jpg)

Step2 Once you click on ‚ÄúExport Media‚Äù you‚Äôll notice different options. Ignore the video export options (or tick off 'video' if you like), then navigate down to the ‚ÄúCaptions tab‚Äù.

Step3 Click on ‚ÄúCreate Sidecar File‚Äù under 'Export Options.

![click on create sidecar file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/fix-for-exporting-srt-file-from-premiere-2.jpg)

### Method 2: Export SRT as Sidecar File

Another way to export SRT files from Adobe Premiere Pro is by exporting the file as a sidecar file. You might ask ‚ÄúWhat is a sidecar file?‚Äù A sidecar file refers to a computer file that stores data that is not supported by the format of its source file. The sidecar file from the source could be more than one, and it could contain meta databases.

Now let‚Äôs take a look at the step-by-step process to export SRT as a sidecar file.

Step1 Click on the ‚ÄúSRT File‚Äù from the Premiere Pro interface.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Method 3: Export SRT File with Timestamps

The previously mentioned methods will allow you to export SRT either with video or as a sidecar file. But if you‚Äôre looking to export SRT file with timestamps, this method will work for you. The process is straightforward as the prior discussed methods.

Step2 Up next, click File -> Export -> Captions. Once you complete that, you‚Äôll export the SRT file as a sidecar file with timestamps.
