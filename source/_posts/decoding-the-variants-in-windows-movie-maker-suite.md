The initial version was included with Windows Me in 2000, but Windows 2000, which came out months before, did not have it, which is why it was missing from the latter. Industry players didn't really pay much attention to WMM since it didn't provide enough features to compete with its rivals. Microsoft chose to produce version 1.1 after realizing WMM's drawbacks. That version was made available at the same time as the Windows XP OS from Microsoft.

![windows movie maker 2000](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/windows-movie-maker-2000.jpg)

For this, Windows Movie Maker's first port was created. On the right side, a video preview is shown. There is room to add images, music, and other media on the left. The plot may be found at the very bottom. Even with capabilities like file input, live video recording, clip segmentation, clip organization, post-production editing, Windows Media file export functionality, and email sharing ability, the WMM version was still subpar.

## 2\. Windows Vista

### **Download Link:** [**Windows Movie Maker**](https://windows-movie-maker-for-vista.soft32.com/)

When Windows Vista was introduced in 2006, Microsoft included a new version of Windows Movie Maker with the new operating system. The video editing tool now has a number of sophisticated capabilities, including fresh effects and transitions.

Additionally, certain Vista development builds included with this edition of Windows Movie Maker. The program was simple to use and integrated with Microsoft's applications. By dragging and moving the item on the time code, you may employ multimedia material in the project with the helpful explorer. A capture wizard included with WMM6 produces DVR-MS-style files from HDV tapes but is unable to record video. Vista is needed for installation.
