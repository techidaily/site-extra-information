Due to its extensive feature set, it takes the top spot on our short list of the best cloud backup services. You receive 10GB of free storage space, which scales up to 10TB on paid plans; these plans are highly affordable compared to the amount of storage they offer.

## Detailed Review: 20 Best Free Cloud Storage Services

Here is a compilation of the 20 **best free cloud storage** services:

### No.1 Userscloud.com

### No. 17\. LetsUpload
