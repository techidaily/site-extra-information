## Achieving Fame on Instagram: The Top 9 Habits of Stars and Influencers

It's no secret that Instagram is a powerful social media platform. With over 1.440 billion users, businesses of all sizes can use Instagram to build brand awareness and boost sales. But becoming an Instagram star takes more than just having great content. You need to have a strategic plan, engage with your followers, and use the right tools and apps.

In this blog post, we'll outline ten steps you can take to achieve Instagram fame. Let's get started!

## 1\. Create a strong Instagram strategy

![create a strong instagram strategy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-an-instagram-star-01.jpg)

The first step to becoming an Instagram star is creating a strong Instagram strategy. This means thinking about your goals, target audience, and brand voice. Once you have a clear direction, you can start creating content that aligns with your strategy.

## 2\. Optimize your Instagram profile

![optimize your instagram profile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-an-instagram-star-02.jpg)

Make sure your Instagram profile is optimized for success. This means adding a clear profile picture, bio, and link to your website. Use relevant keywords in your bio so that people can easily find you. And don't forget to post regularly! Consistency is key on Instagram.

## 3\. Post-high-quality photos and videos

![post high-quality photos and videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-an-instagram-star-03.jpg)

High-quality photos and videos are key to gaining a following on Instagram. Posting attractive and visually appealing content will help you get noticed by potential followers.

## 4\. Engage with your followers

![engage with your followers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-an-instagram-star-04.jpg)

Followers want to see that you're active and involved, so post regularly and respond to comments and DMs. Seek opportunities to collaborate with other influencers and brands, and host giveaways and contests to keep your followers engaged.

## 5\. Use the right tools and apps

![use the right tools and apps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-an-instagram-star-05.jpg)

You'll need more than just great photos. You'll also need to use the right tools and apps to help you grow your account. Instagram Stars typically use a variety of apps to help them with everything from editing their photos to scheduling their posts. They also often use analytics tools to track their growth and engagement.

Using the right tools and apps, you can give yourself a leg up on the competition and start building your own following.

## 6\. Follow other Instagram stars

If you're hoping to become an Instagram star, one of the best things you can do is follow other Instagram stars. Not only will this give you an idea of what it takes to be successful on Instagram, but it will also help you build up a following of your own.

Though, there are a few things to keep in mind when you're following Instagram stars.

* Make sure that you're only following accounts that are relevant to your interests. There's no point in following someone who doesn't post content you're interested in.
* Take the time to engage with the content that you're seeing. Like and comment on photos and videos, and start conversations with other users. By taking the time to interact with the content on Instagram, you'll begin to build up a following of your own.
* Don't be afraid to experiment with your content. Instagram is all about creativity, so try posting something different from time to time. Mixing things up will keep your followers engaged and coming back for more.

So, if you're hoping to become an Instagram star, don't forget to follow other Instagram stars. It's a great way to start your journey to Instagram success.

## 7\. Use hashtags to get more followers

![use hashtags to get more followers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-an-instagram-star-07.jpg)

For many Instagram stars, hashtags played a crucial role in helping them to get more followers and grow their businesses.

By carefully selecting and using relevant hashtags, Instagram stars can reach a much wider audience than they would if they relied solely on their existing network of followers. When used correctly, hashtags can help Instagram stars appear in the top posts for specific keywords, exposing them to a whole new group of potential followers.

In addition, many Instagram users actively search for new content using hashtags, which means that using the right hashtags can help you attract an engaged audience that is genuinely interested in what you offer.

So, if you want to become an Instagram star, don't underestimate the power of a good hashtag strategy!

## 8\. Plan your posts ahead of time

![plan your post ahead of time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-an-instagram-star-08.jpg)

If you're determined to become an Instagram Star, one of the best things you can do is to plan your posts ahead of time. This might seem like a lot of work, but it's simple.

* First, look at your schedule and figure out when you'll have the most time to take and edit photos.
* Then, start brainstorming ideas for what you want to post. It doesn't have to be complicated - just some quick snapshots of your everyday life.
* Once you have a few ideas, start planning out each post. Write down what you want to say and include any hashtags or keywords you want to use.

Planning will help you stay on track and ensure that your Instagram page is always fresh and engaging.

## 9\. Promote your Instagram account on other channels

![promote your instagram account on other channels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-an-instagram-star-09.jpg)

To make a name for yourself on Instagram, you must promote your account on other channels. That means sharing your photos on Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat. It means actively engaging with other users, commenting on their pictures, and leaving thoughtful compliments.

## 10\. Analyze your performance metrics

![analyze your performance metrics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-an-instagram-star-10.jpg)

It's essential to analyze your performance metrics by closely examining your likes, comments, and followers; you can better understand what content is resonating with your audience.

You can also use insights to track your growth over time and see how your content is performing. With this information, you can adjust your strategy and improve your chances of becoming an Instagram star.

By following these simple steps, you'll be on your way to Instagram stardom. Good luck!
