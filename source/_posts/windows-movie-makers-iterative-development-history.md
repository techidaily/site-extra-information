### **Download Link:** **Windows Movie Maker**

The initial version was included with Windows Me in 2000, but Windows 2000, which came out months before, did not have it, which is why it was missing from the latter. Industry players didn't really pay much attention to WMM since it didn't provide enough features to compete with its rivals. Microsoft chose to produce version 1.1 after realizing WMM's drawbacks. That version was made available at the same time as the Windows XP OS from Microsoft.

For this, Windows Movie Maker's first port was created. On the right side, a video preview is shown. There is room to add images, music, and other media on the left. The plot may be found at the very bottom. Even with capabilities like file input, live video recording, clip segmentation, clip organization, post-production editing, Windows Media file export functionality, and email sharing ability, the WMM version was still subpar.

## 2\. Windows Vista
