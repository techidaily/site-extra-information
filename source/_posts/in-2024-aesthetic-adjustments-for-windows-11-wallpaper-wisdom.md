For setting Windows 11 background wallpaper, it is not necessary to use the Settings app as File Explorer can also do the job for you. Steps for that are given below.

Step 1: Firstly, open File Explorer and then head over to the folder that contains the pictures that you want for the wallpaper.

Step 2: Now, by right-clicking on the image file, a menu will appear. From that menu, go for the option of 'Set as desktop Background.' This will set your Windows 11 wallpaper.

Step 2: By right-clicking on the picture, a pop-up menu will show up. Select the option of 'Set Image as Desktop Background.'
