#### 2.Cartoon Face Lens

Snapchat’s Cartoon Face Lens can be effectively used on humans and animals. This filter swaps out your eyebrows and eyes for ones that look as if you belong in a Disney animated classic. What makes this Cartoon Face Lens a popular filter is that it portrays users in a completely different avatar. All you need is a smartphone with a camera and your Snapchat app to send a snap with the cartoon face lens to your friends.

#### 3.Cartoon Effect

The Cartoon Effect Lens of Snapchat is another cartoon filter that’s loved by millennial users. It is a weirdly realistic rendering of what you would look like as a cartoon. Besides paying good attention to the details, the Lens is pretty spot-on in mimicking your expressions.

#### 4.Anime Style

Snapchat’s Anime Style takes its inspiration from the animation style that originated from the East. The Anime Style Lens gives you a makeover in an anime-style of animation and follows each of your expressions in real-time. The filter has a nice soft shading style that’s surprisingly artistic and looks almost like it’s been hand-drawn. Also, it’s fun to try making different expressions as they tend to transform your new anime self entirely.

### Conclusion

Virtually revamping your overall look to resemble your favorite Cartoon character has never been easier, all thanks to the appearance-changing filters of Snapchat. Send a snap with the cartoon face lens daily to your friends and it will create a particular chain referred to as streak. So take cartoon selfies of yourself daily and develop the longest streak with your friends for as long as you can. More friends, more fun, and you will no longer be bored!
