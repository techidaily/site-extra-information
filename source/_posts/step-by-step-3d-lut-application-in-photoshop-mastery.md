## What is 3D LUT?

3D LUT (Look-Up-Table) is a function key that maps a given color space to another. Technically, LUTs are used for complex processes such as converting an image shot from a Canon Log profile and making it more enticing or converting one image color space to its better version.

Working with LUTs, there are two types; 3D LUT and 1D LUT. The difference is that the former provides room for complex color operations, whereas the latter has limitations on the number of color operations.

Here are more differences between 3D and 1D LUTs:

##### 3D LUT

It Places luma and color in a 3D (Cube) form; hence very easy to work with.

The output values are not from each respective combination in a color space.

It is a bit complex when customizing the basic settings such as contrast and white balance. Usually, the final result becomes remarkable.

##### 1D LUT

The color and luma are placed in a 1D; hence quite not easy to work on.

It contains a clear value of the outputs and on the basis of the bit depth, i.e., 1024 values in a 10 - bit.

It is a walk in the park when it comes to adjustments to the basic settings such as contrast, brightness, and white balance. But, the resulting output will be mid.

Wrapping up the differences, 3D LUTs are essential for colorists and editors since they can carry out tons of color customizations. Therefore, they can make their work uniquely stunning.

## Conclusion

● Turn your footage into a masterpiece with 3D LUTs in Photoshop. By majoring in customizability and the number of operations, it is clear that 3D LUTs are way better than 1D LUT. Download free 3D LUTs from the sources above and import them to your Photoshop app.

● When using LUTs, there are a couple of things that you need to have right under your nose:

* Make sure that the white balance is accurate
* Carry out small adjustments to your footage, i.e., saturation and contrast, for you to obtain exemplary results
* Have correct exposure. You can use a histogram to aid you in this.
