 Drones or UAVs are designed with capabilities to fly in air without a pilot. Their movements are mainly controlled by a remote unit in most of the cases whereas few highly advanced designs are operated from computers.

 There are so many varieties of drones that you can easily find in world and all of them are working for different applications so we cannot define any set criteria for their classification. Depending upon the need or applications, they can have variable size and design.

 One of the most common applications of drone technology is in military as it helps to control surveillance related issues with ease. Places where humans cannot enter directly can be easily monitored by an air flying unit and it can also capture photographs of critical locations. Here we are going to discuss various types of drones and for ease of understating they are categorized into four basic sections: Numbers of propellers used inside, their size, flying range and equipments.

 They can be designed with a common size range varying from a large sized insect to a 50 cm long unit. Two most common designs in this category are: Mini Drones and Nano/ Micro Drones. The nano drones are widely used due to their tiny structure and light weight construction as they work like essential weapons for spying.

#### 2. Mini Drones

![mini drones
](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mini-drones.jpg
)

 They have a size little bigger then micro drones that means will go above 50 cm but will have maximum 2m dimension. Most of these drone models are designed with fixed wings type construction whereas few can have rotary wings. Due to their small size they lack in power.

#### 3. Medium Drones

 This category of drones presents heavier units but are lighter and smaller then aircrafts. These drones can carry weight up to 200 Kgs and have average flying capacity of 5 to 10 minutes. One of the most popular designs under this category is UK watchkeeper.

#### 4. Large Drones

![large drones
](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/large-drones.jpg
)

 Large drones are somewhat comparable to size of aircraft and are most commonly used for military applications. Placed that cannot be covered with normal jets are usually captured with these drones. They are main device for surveillance applications. Users can also classify them further into different categories depending upon their range and flying abilities.

#### Section 3: According to Range

#### 1. Very Close Range Drones

![very close range drones
](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/very-close-range-drones.jpg
)

 They act like a favorite toy for most of the kids. They are able to fly up to 5 Km with fly time of 20 to 45 minutes when equipped with powerful batteries. Some of the most commonly used units in this category are Raven and Dragon Eye.

 Drones or UAVs are designed with capabilities to fly in air without a pilot. Their movements are mainly controlled by a remote unit in most of the cases whereas few highly advanced designs are operated from computers.

 There are so many varieties of drones that you can easily find in world and all of them are working for different applications so we cannot define any set criteria for their classification. Depending upon the need or applications, they can have variable size and design.

 One of the most common applications of drone technology is in military as it helps to control surveillance related issues with ease. Places where humans cannot enter directly can be easily monitored by an air flying unit and it can also capture photographs of critical locations. Here we are going to discuss various types of drones and for ease of understating they are categorized into four basic sections: Numbers of propellers used inside, their size, flying range and equipments.

## Different types of Drones
