## Part 1: What is an Avatar?

Generally, an avatar refers to an icon or figure representing a person in a video game, social media platform, etc. In other words, a representation of you on the internet. When Metaverse Avatar comes about, think of an icon representing you in the VR (Virtual Reality). Therefore, as technical experts talk of Metaverse, an avatar is equally essential. Why? Because it is what you use to identify yourself in the digital world.

Think of it in the sense of how you go about opening a social media account. Typically, you will upload your photo as a visual representation of yourself on the platform. The same case happens when dealing with Metaverse; you need an avatar. However, in this case, you don't need your real photo since you settle for a figure where you dress it and design it as per your taste and preference.
