## Part1: What is the av01 codec?

Initially, companies relied on proprietary technology to provide you with video content. For example, most video providers were using variants of MPEG codecs to edit their online content, with others preferring  for 4K content. However, using this method proved expensive and meant that some companies were missing out on the lucrative video streaming market.

As such, the Alliance for Open Media was formed in 2015 to develop an open-source, royalty-free video codec to outperform all previous versions. Through this collaboration, the Aomedia Video 1 (AV1) codec came to be. Here are some questions to help you understand the technology much better.

### What is a codec, and what is the AV01 codec?

A codec is a type of compression technology that consists of two parts:

* An encoder compresses the original file to smaller sizes that you can share through the internet or other portable storage.
* A decoder to decompress the file to its original format.

In addition, you can use different types of codecs depending on the file format. For example, MPEG codecs were the preferred choice for video files. However, streaming companies now use codec AV1 for their content. This is because it offers faster compression times and smaller files than other previous video codecs.

### Is it popular?

Yes, it is. Since its introduction in May 2018, more companies have been integrating the codec in their offerings. Here is a list of companies that offer AV1 codec support:

* Google offers AV1 codec support for Chrome web browser and all Android 10+ smart devices, including your mobile and smart TV. In addition, you can also video chat on Google Duo using the AV1 codec.
* Microsoft also offers AV1 codec support for their Edge browser.
* Other companies that offer codec AV1 support with their software include Opera, Mozilla Firefox, VLC Media Player, and Vivaldi.
* Samsung and LG support 8K streaming on their Q950TS and ZX-OLED TVs, respectively.
* Intel and NVIDIA also offer HD AV1 support with their graphics processing units.
* Additionally, video content providers such as Amazon, Netflix, and YouTube offer AV01 codec support through their devices and online platforms.
* Following successful tests in 2018, Facebook now uses the AV1 codec for videos on the platform.

### Where is AV1 codec used?

The AV1 codec is offered on a license-free basis to any interested user. Furthermore, the AOMedia patent license is fully compliant with the W3C Patent Policy, meaning you will not face any legal ramifications if you use the technology. As such, you will find the technology available on non-AOMedia member devices. For example, Broadcom offers AV1 codec support on its BCM 72190 and 72180 chipsets for Android TVs.

## Part2: What are the best video editors to edit an AV1 format video?
