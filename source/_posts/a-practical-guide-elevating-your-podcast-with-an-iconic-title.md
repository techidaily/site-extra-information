When choosing a podcast name, it would be best to keep your target audience in mind. What phrase is popular among them? What kind of tone would make your podcast name attract them? Etc.

Having a searchable podcast name is very smart, and you can do so by incorporating keywords related to the theme of your show into your podcast name.
