## Conclusion

● Turn your footage into a masterpiece with 3D LUTs in Photoshop. By majoring in customizability and the number of operations, it is clear that 3D LUTs are way better than 1D LUT. Download free 3D LUTs from the sources above and import them to your Photoshop app.

● When using LUTs, there are a couple of things that you need to have right under your nose:

* Make sure that the white balance is accurate
* Carry out small adjustments to your footage, i.e., saturation and contrast, for you to obtain exemplary results
* Have correct exposure. You can use a histogram to aid you in this.
