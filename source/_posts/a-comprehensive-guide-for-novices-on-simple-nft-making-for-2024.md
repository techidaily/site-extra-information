It's entirely conceivable to wander into the metaverse with your iOS or Android gadget. You can get stages like Roblox after downloading its app at no cost. Others like Axie Boundlessness are available through Android, even though they're not accessible on the iPhone.

### 2\. A computer

"I would say the Metaverse is, as of now, for the most part, a PC/Mac experience. Either browser-based or desktop-based—so clients can get to new sorts of immersive experiences," said Sébastien Borget, COO and co-founder of the Sandbox, one of the foremost well-known metaverse stages.
