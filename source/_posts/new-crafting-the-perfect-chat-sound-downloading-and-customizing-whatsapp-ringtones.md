If your taste doesn’t match the available **WhatsApp ringtones** on the sites mentioned above, here’s a handy way to create personalized WhatsApp tones using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Filmora is a user-friendly video editor. You can easily detach the audio from the video clip and customize your own ringtone. Besides, if you are worried that the video file with your favourite audio has silent moments and you don’t want to break the whole audio, Filmora can also help you with that!

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Step1 In the first step, open a browser on your PC, head over to **Wondershare Filmora’s** site, and download the latest software version. Next, launch the software and click **“Import”** on the main dashboard and add two keen WhatsApp video songs to make a personalized **WhatsApp ringtone**.

Step2 Drag the keen video songs to the **“Timeline Panel”** at the bottom. Now, right-click the songs and select **“Detach Audio”** to extract Keen WhatsApp audio from videos. The audio files will then automatically show on the audio track.
