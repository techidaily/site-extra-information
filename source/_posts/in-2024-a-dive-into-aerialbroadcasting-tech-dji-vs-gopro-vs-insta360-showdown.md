2. **Find the "Lens Correction" Option**: Within the "Correction" tab, you should find the "Lens Correction" option.
3. **Apply Lens Correction:** After selecting the "Lens Correction" option, Filmora will provide you with various controls and settings to correct the fisheye effect.
4. **Adjust the Slider**: Once you've applied the lens correction, you'll likely see a slider or multiple sliders that allow you to control the level of correction.
