Moreover, position chapters on the same track and adjust each clip side by side without leaving any gaps. You can always detach audio by right-clicking individual clips and selecting the ‘Detach Audio’ feature from the ‘Audio’ option.

**Step 3: Export Your Videos**

After you finish merging GoPro videos, click the ‘Export’ button to save the single video made from multiple clips on your system.

## **Conclusion**
