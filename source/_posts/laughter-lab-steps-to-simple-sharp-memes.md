## Laughter Lab: Steps to Simple, Sharp Memes

It only takes one amusing thing to find on the internet for your day to be instantly improved. When you post your own unique brand of wit and humor in the form of memes, remember to do the same for other people. With the help of this article, you can quickly and effortlessly transform a memorable occasion into a meme that will spread like wildfire.

Let’s start off!

## 1\. What exactly is a meme?

A meme is an image that is passed around online and is accompanied by some form of writing. These memes typically offer sharp criticism on cultural icons, societal concepts, or current events. A meme is often an image or a video, although it can also take the form of a string of words in some cases. When a meme strikes a chord with a large number of people, it begins to circulate through various social platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, messaging, and other methods. The more the number of times a meme is shared, the more of an impact it has on culture.

## 2\. When did memes become a thing online?

Memes, which originated as an idea conceived from an improbable source, have emerged as one of the key modes of communication that are used on the internet. Memes have almost completely taken over popular culture, and they can be found just about anywhere. Your favorite artist, a member of your family, or even a politician may be the one who spreads them. Anything, even humans, has the potential to spread virally and turn into a meme. If you get extremely lucky, becoming a meme can even make you famous.

At one point in time, many believed that memes were nothing more than strange visuals that certain portions of the internet created for their own amusement. They are now an integral element of the typical engagement that takes place on social media and are utilized, shared, and consumed on a minute-to-minute basis. They can take something as harmless as the children's show Arthur and turn the visuals into something that causes the authors of the series to issue an apology, or they can make fun of the very idea of possessing a certain guitar model.

People's lives are becoming increasingly influenced by the internet and various forms of social media, which has coincided with the proliferation of memes in popular culture. Memes have evolved into the ideal medium for disseminating knowledge, comedic content, and political viewpoints as the amount of time spent online continues to rise. Memes have evolved from simple image changes made with the intention of making people laugh into rhetorical devices that are capable of spreading information to millions of people. As a result, memes have established themselves as one of the most important mediums in today's society. This is how the meme has progressed over time.

## 3\. How do you make a meme?

It’s quite simple to create your own memes. All you need is a good picture of something, or someone expressing an emotion such a confusion, happiness, and think of a funny phrase people can relate to.

Step1 When you set out to create a meme, you should typically do so with an idea in mind. But if that's not possible, try to come up with a hilarious response.

Step2 Launch Filmora, then important the photo, and after that, choose the font you want to use. Position the text until it looks like a proper meme.

Step3 You may show your finished work to your coworkers or friends by saving and uploading it immediately to social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter.

Memes are a fantastic way to communicate with friends, family, and coworkers. They're also really simple to create! No prior tool experience is necessary. Absolutely! Use [Filmora's](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) GIF function to quickly convert any video clip into an animated GIF meme that you can share with others.

## 4\. Researching trending memes

Through the years, many different styles of memes have come and gone. You don't want to rely on methods that have since become obsolete. Do some research to find out what's trending by looking through old memes. Also, pay attention to the memes that other people are posting wherever it is on the internet that you spend the majority of your time. It doesn't matter if it's Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.

Try to locate recent memes by browsing subreddits such as r/memes and r/dankmemes. In addition, there are times when a particular category of meme becomes popular. In that case, you should give those memes a shot and see if you can make them. For instance, Bernie Sanders was a topic of conversation for a few days not too long ago.

## 5\. Share your meme

You are now equipped with everything you require to begin creating hilarious memes. To review, you are now familiar with the process of creating a meme by either using a meme template that is blank so that you may add new meme captions or by making use of a screenshot tool to generate an entirely new meme.

If neither of these techniques works for you, another option is to use image editing software to generate new memes by uploading your own images or creating new memes from existing ones. When it comes to creating and distributing your very own memes, the number of options that are available to you is virtually limitless. Also, who knows, maybe you'll come up with the next meme that becomes popular!

## Conclusion

And that’s it! Some of the most popular meme producers on the internet have some ideas about where they think the culture of memes might be headed in the future, despite the fact that the future of memes is difficult to forecast due to the fact that meme culture is always changing.
