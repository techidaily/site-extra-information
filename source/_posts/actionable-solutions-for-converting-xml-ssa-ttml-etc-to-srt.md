## What does SRT, SSA, XML, etc., look like?

### 1\. SRT

First, there’s a section for subtitle number, which is followed by the time at which the subtitle appears and ends. Then comes the subtitle that will appear.

![subRip subtitle file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-xml-to-srt-19.jpg)

### 2\. SSA

It is a plain text file that is composed of three sections, Script Info, Styles, and Events.

![xml subtitle file appearance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-xml-to-srt-3.jpg)

### 3\. XML

This subtitle format contains encoding, duration, and content of subtitles like this,

![ttml subtitle file appearance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-xml-to-srt-4.jpg)

### 4\. TTML
