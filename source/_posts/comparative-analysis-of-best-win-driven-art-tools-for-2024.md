Digital painting may easily become the most dominant art form in the future since more and more artists are producing their art in the digital format. The widespread and accessibility of drawing apps for Windows also contributes to the popularity of digital painting.

However, such diversity of software products that can be used for drawing or painting may be confusing especially for someone who is just getting started. What’s more, the tools a drawing app offers can limit the scope of your options and ultimately lower the quality of your artwork.

We combed the Internet in search of best free and paid drawing apps for Windows and we’ve shortlisted those that have to offer the most to both skilled and unskilled users.

Digital painting may easily become the most dominant art form in the future since more and more artists are producing their art in the digital format. The widespread and accessibility of drawing apps for Windows also contributes to the popularity of digital painting.

However, such diversity of software products that can be used for drawing or painting may be confusing especially for someone who is just getting started. What’s more, the tools a drawing app offers can limit the scope of your options and ultimately lower the quality of your artwork.

We combed the Internet in search of best free and paid drawing apps for Windows and we’ve shortlisted those that have to offer the most to both skilled and unskilled users.

## Top 10 Drawing Apps for Windows

The purpose for which you will be using a drawing app is often the best guideline to follow while choosing a software you intend to use to create digital paintings and drawings since there isn’t much sense in spending a lot of money on a software product that offers advanced features you will never use.

Here’s what drawing apps for Windows have to offer.

All PC users can create digital drawings for free, and they don’t even need to install a third-party app. Microsoft Paint 3D is the Windows 10 native app that grants you access to all tools you need to create digital painting and drawings.

Besides an excellent collection of brushes, you also get access to a variety of 2D and 3D shapes, stickers, and text options. In addition, you can choose from a broad range of lighting options, and decide if you want to give your images gloss, matte, or some other type of finish. Microsoft Paint 3D is a great option if you are just starting to learn how to make digital drawings, but still want an app that offers at least some advanced options.

### 2. [Microsoft Fresh Paint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/fresh-paint/9wzdncrfjb13?activetab=pivot:regionofsystemrequirementstab)

Switching between different brushes, using a sketchpad, or manipulating large numbers of layers are only a few among numerous options this app offers. Moreover, Fresh Paint gives you complete control over the intensity of the colors, while you can also choose if you want to clean your brush before you start using a new color or mix multiple colors. This drawing app has a lot to offer to seasoned digital artists and users who would like to learn the basics of digital drawing and painting.

The app provides support for pressure-sensitive graphics tablets and it features a dynamic brush library that can be extended through third-party app integrations.

### 4. [PAINT.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/)

Performing the basic photo editing tasks or creating a digital drawing with PAINT.NET isn’t difficult, but the app doesn’t offer any advanced features, which makes it ill-suited for professional use.
