If you're a content creator, YouTube, or more, adding subtitles to your videos will help viewers understand the information you're passing more concisely. Although there are lots of subtitles formats available, SRT is the best we recommend you should always opt for because it's a universal subtitle format, making it usable on any platform be it YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Vimeo, Premiere Pro, etc.

Regardless of whatever you're planning to do with your video, it's important you know the right subtitle format that's supported on the platform you're looking to upload videos. The table below shows different platforms that support the SRT subtitle format;
