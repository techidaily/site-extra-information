### Social Media

Everything you need now can be found on social media, just type in the search button what you are looking for and everything will appear. When used strategically, social media can lead you to quality talent. The film community is a tight knit and social bunch.

On Facebook or Twitter use hashtag to search and monitor conversations surrounding video professionals. Like or follow the pages and accounts that are comprised of video professionals.

If you find an individual or company that seems to fit what you are looking for, check out their pages and look at some of their samples or portfolio. Their page will most likely have short videos across their feed and a link to their website for you to check out more. Look through their reel and some of their full videos while checking of quality and an aesthetic that parallels your wants.

### Personal Recommendation

Word of mouth is often the best route to take when hiring freelancer for a video project. Talk to your colleagues and friends who have hired video professionals, and ask them for recommendations. It can save you a lot of time and effort.

For best results, as with any project you outsource, it is imperative to be very clear about your expectations and your timeline. The right professional will ask a lot of questions up front and deliver result on time.

And let's be honest you can often negotiate a discount price if the person knows their recommendation well. So feel free to go to different people in your network to wind up with to three options, then evaluate the videographers and pick the best one.

So don't be shy to ask a friend, a family or a colleagues if they know someone who is a good videographer that they will recommend to catch your special event.

Sometimes it's better to just get a recommended one since you'll have a hard time looking for it everywhere.

### Marketing Agency

There are also many marketing agencies that you can go to find a videographer but of course you only need to find a trustworthy agency. Don't forget to take a close look at their latest work, do a research about the videographer site first because there you can read recommendations or comments from their clients about the videographer work.

Shop around and try to find a studio that can accommodate your budget. Always check their past work extensively to see if their style will translate well for your needs.
