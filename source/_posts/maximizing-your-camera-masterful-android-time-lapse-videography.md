* For shooting flowers blossom time or rotting fruit, it is recommended to keep the Airplane Mode on since the process is relatively long and any call between the shoot could hamper the video.
* Lastly, please ensure to have sufficient space in your SD card, 1GB at Also, for a time-lapse video, your device should be charged fully.

## Part4: Differences between Hyper Lapse and Time Lapse

You have learnt almost everything about time-lapse videography. We also think you should know how hyper-lapse and time-lapse distinguishes from each other. These two techniques are not same. The technique of hyper-lapse video includes a moving camera in contrast with the time-lapse videos. It is part of time-lapse videography where the camera is moving at different angles and exposures. Keeping it simpler, a time-lapse video is made with keeping camera undisturbed whereas hyper-lapse videos involverecording the video while moving the camera.
