People use it as a form of effector to share their perspectives. You can distort pic for various reasons. They include:

#### 1\. Allows You to Have Fun

Adding distortion effects to your pic is a fun thing to do. It's always interesting to see what things will look like after adding distortion filters to your photo. You can have an enormous amount of fun, creativity, craziness, and laughing with your pics.

#### 2\. Helps You a Distinct Look

One of the simplest ways of making your pics distinct is by adding distortion effects. These effects can make your images stand out within seconds. Because it allows you to create eye-catching pics by adding instant charm, distorting pics can help you attract viewers to your work.

These online tools offer multiple photo distortion filters and effects that you can add to your image and distort its look. After applying a filter, you can manually adjust the intensity of your distortion filter to suit your preferences.

Some of the images you can distort using online tools include:

* Over-Exposition: This is when the person in the photo is too bright or overexposed to show the subject's features.
* Under-Exposure: This is when the person in the photo is too dark or under-exposed to show the subject's features.
* Visual Stretching is when you digitally stretch an image to the desired size, sometimes using a "zoom" feature to get closer or broader shots of the subject.
