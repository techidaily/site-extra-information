Google Cardboard is the VR platform developed and intended to be used for this app. This can also be used for their Smartphone displaying an immersive VR and journalism-focused environment.

In connection with this, it is also a useful and free news application intended to be used for iPhone. A total of six screenshots have been recorded so far including “The Displaced”, “Take Flight”, “Vigils in Paris”.
