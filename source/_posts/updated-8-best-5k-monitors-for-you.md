The quality of the images professional and consumer [digital cameras](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can capture has been improving steadily since the turn of the century. Today [cameras that can capture 4K](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)or 8K footage have become the industry standard, which is why video editors are in constant need of monitors that can display high-resolution images accurately.

Moreover, programmers, graphic designers, and gamers often need more than what 4K monitors that are currently available on the market can offer. Even though the obvious solution to the shortcomings of 4K monitors lies in getting displays that have higher resolutions, 5K monitors are still not widely accepted by professionals across different industries. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best 5K monitors you can buy.

## What’s 5K Resolution?

Before we take a look at different models of 5K monitors, we are going to take a moment to shed some light on what 5K resolution actually is. The exact resolution of 5K monitors that have 16:9 aspect ratios can vary slightly depending on the model, but the most common 5K resolution is 5120X2880 or 14.7 million pixels.

![5k high resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5k-high-resolution.jpg)

This means that 5K monitors offer 33.33% more pixels on both horizontal and vertical sides than 4K monitors. This extra space can be useful to video editors who want to view 4K footage at native resolution while still being able to see the interface of the app they are using to process it.

As [4K](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) content is growing more popular, 5K monitors are becoming more useful, which might make them more available on the markets around the globe in the next few years. However, 5K resolution is still not a standard digital cinematography format in 2024, since most video content creators opt to shoot their footage in Full HD or 4K resolution.

The quality of the images professional and consumer [digital cameras](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can capture has been improving steadily since the turn of the century. Today [cameras that can capture 4K](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)or 8K footage have become the industry standard, which is why video editors are in constant need of monitors that can display high-resolution images accurately.

Moreover, programmers, graphic designers, and gamers often need more than what 4K monitors that are currently available on the market can offer.

### 5\. Dell U4919DW

**Best for:**Video editors, graphic designers, coders

**Price:**$1349.99

It hardly comes as a surprise that one of the best 5K monitors on the market comes from Dell, a company that has been at the forefront of the tech industry for decades. This recently released curved ultrawide monitor has a 32:9 aspect ratio and a 5120x1440 resolution that guarantees high image quality. The panel has an anti-glare finish that eliminates reflections and a wide viewing angle that allows you to see images accurately from virtually any angle.

This model requires minimum calibration as it ships with 99% sRGB factory calibration at Delta E less than 2\. The VESA-compatible mount grants you complete freedom so that you can tilt, swivel or adjust the monitor’s height in any way you want. The U4919DW’s connection options are equally impressive since this 5K monitor features a DisplayPort, two HDMI ports and several USB upstream and downstream ports.

**Pros**

### 6\. Philips 499P9H

**Best for:**Creative and tech industry professionals, gamers

**Price:**$1050

This is easily one of the most impressive 5K monitors you can find on the market in 2024, so you can hardly go wrong if you opt for the 499P9H model. The 49-inch display has a 32:9 aspect ratio and an anti-glare, 2H, Haze 25% screen coating that enables you to work on this 5K monitor under all types of light conditions.

The VA LCD panel doesn’t have a viewing angle that is as wide as the viewing angle that you can expect from IPS panels, but the 1800R curvature ensures that all images displayed on this 5K monitor can be viewed from almost any horizontal or vertical angle. Philips 499P9H also offers HRD support and it has a minimum input lag, which means that you can use it for gaming purposes. Moreover, this 5K model is equipped with a 2-megapixel FHD camera, a microphone and a pair of 5W speakers.

**Pros**

* Excellent 3000:1 contrast ratio

The display has a 3000:1 contrast ratio as well as a Mega dynamic contrast ratio that ensure that brightest and darkest areas of the screen are perfectly balanced. Samsung CRG90 is also HDR10 compatible, but you should keep in mind that you need a powerful hardware setup in order to utilize all of the monitor’s features to the fullest.

**Pros**

* Huge diagonal size

### 8\. LG 49WL95C

**Best for:**Video editing, graphic design, common use

**Price:**$1,499.99

In case you are looking to maximize your workflow by replacing your dual monitor setup, LG 49WL95C may be the right solution for you, since it substitutes two 2,560 x 1,440 displays. Its curved IPS panel has a 32:9 aspect ratio and 178-degree horizontal and vertical viewing angles.

Even though LG 49WL95C has 5ms response time, its refresh rate is at 60 Hz which makes this model only a modest gaming option. Even so, this LG’s 5K monitor model supports HDR and it is flicker safe. There are two HDMI ports, an USB Type-C port, a DisplayPort and a headphone out as well as a 10W speaker.

You can use this 5K monitor for a wide array of purposes that range from video editing to watching movies. However, you should make sure that the computer you have is capable of performing the tasks LG 49WL95C was designed to support.

**Pros**

* Excellent color accuracy
* Elegant bezeless design
* Anti-glare coating
* Solid connectivity options

**Cons**
