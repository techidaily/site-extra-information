## Part 3\. Make Him or Her Swipe Right: Create Attractive Profiles

Tinder bio is a small blank space that takes a minute to fill but content matters. While guys most probably swipe over the top to bottom without noting down the Tinder profile description, girls are selective in choosing the perfect match before swipe right.

So, here are some tips for creating a better attractive Tinder profile.

### 1\. Use Tinder Loop

Tinder introduced a Tinder loop, a video feature that increases the chances of getting swiped right. With this attribute, you can capture favorite activities like cliff jumping, and shooting hoops, showcase them to your **Tinder profile**.

As you can import videos from the iOS camera roll, you can create or customize videos using [video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) software like [Filmora from Wondershare](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and add cool effects, transitions, overlays, reversed videos, etc.

### 2\. Make it creative/funny/amazing but keep it simple

The best **Tinder bio idea** is to be creative, funny to get a swipe-right or a perfect match. Blend a little fun with humor; keep it simple so that it could tell a story in just a few words. Make it concise with 3 to 4 sentences.

### 4\. Synchronize with other social media network

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 5\. Be real and honest

Even though tinder is just an online dating app, it doesn’t mean that you should be unreal or dishonest. You can be casual as it is getting around with new people, and hence you need to be clear in whom you are, what you like, and what you need.

## Part 3\. Make Him or Her Swipe Right: Create Attractive Profiles

Tinder bio is a small blank space that takes a minute to fill but content matters. While guys most probably swipe over the top to bottom without noting down the Tinder profile description, girls are selective in choosing the perfect match before swipe right.

So, here are some tips for creating a better attractive Tinder profile.

### 1\. Use Tinder Loop

Tinder introduced a Tinder loop, a video feature that increases the chances of getting swiped right. With this attribute, you can capture favorite activities like cliff jumping, and shooting hoops, showcase them to your **Tinder profile**.

As you can import videos from the iOS camera roll, you can create or customize videos using [video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) software like [Filmora from Wondershare](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and add cool effects, transitions, overlays, reversed videos, etc.
