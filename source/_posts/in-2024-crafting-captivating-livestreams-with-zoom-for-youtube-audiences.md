## Crafting Captivating Livestreams with Zoom for YouTube Audiences

During the global lockdown period, Zoom has become the most popular platform for organizing meetings and conducting interviews online. Podcasters who have YouTube channels, they conduct video podcasts and interviews on Zoom and broadcast Zoom livestream to YouTube. Therefore, the subscribers and followers of the YouTubers can watch the live Zoom session on YouTube.

As a matter of fact, there are even live events and parties organized on Zoom and broadcast on YouTube so that everyone can enjoy for free. In order to go Zoom YouTube live at the same time, you have to set up livestream on Zoom and YouTube and connect both the platforms. The process involves several steps and we will illustrate how to Zoom live stream to YouTube in detail.
