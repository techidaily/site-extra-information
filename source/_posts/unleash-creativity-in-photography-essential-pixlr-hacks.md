### 9\. Add Effects and Overlays

If you find your image still boring even after adding all the elements, borders, stickers, and drawings, you can apply high-quality effects and overlays to the images within no time. Effects act like filters that can change the color range of your picture, and each effect has a unique quality. The effects offered in this tool are atomic, creative, unicolor, vintage, and too old.

On the other hand, people like to use the feature of overlays to add extra layers and texture to their images for enhancement. Pixlr photo editor offers diverse effects and provides high-quality overlays that you can apply to the picture. Using these options, anyone can convert dull pictures into vibrant and lively ones.

### 10\. Heal and Smooth the Image

Through a healing tool, you can remove the flaws by pointing out the spots to be precise and accurate.

On the other hand, a smooth tool can work like magic by upgrading the resolution of the picture. If your picture has distorted pixels, this specific tool will smooth the imperfections as much as possible. So, transform your imperfect and low-quality pictures into high-end and professional ones through both of these features. Make sure to use this!
