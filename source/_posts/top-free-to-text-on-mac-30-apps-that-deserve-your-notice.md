## Part 6: FAQs

### Is there a difference between voice recognition and speech to text?

Voice recognition software allows your device to capture your accent and tone and then stores that data for different functions, such as user logins and speech to text functionality. For example, Siri will ask you to repeat a sentence several times as one of the setup steps.

### Which is the best external device for the speech to text service?

Most users report better speech to text accuracy when using headsets compared to using an external microphone. This is because the microphone is much closer to your mouth, so your voice is less affected by external noise.

### Can speech to text apps automatically translate a transcribed text?

Yes, they can. Apps such as Google's Speech to Text include a translation feature in their functionality. However, you will need the Google Chrome browser to access Speech to text. This is because the service is only available to active google account holders.

### How much faster is speech to text faster than typing?

A 2017 Stanford study states that speech to text is about[three times faster than typing](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3161187). In addition, it found that speech to text apps can transcribe over 150 words per minute, while professional transcriptionists range between 50 to 80 words per minute.
