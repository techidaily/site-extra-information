Some VLLO app users complain that whenever they try to edit or export large files, the app crashes, making them lose all their content. Moreover, there is no built-in camera within the app, and most of the filters, music, stickers, effects, and other advanced tools are available only for premium users.

## Part 5\. Best VLLO Video Editor Alternative on Desktop

Unfortunately, mobile devices don't have the same processing power as desktop computers. This is why desktop video editing software is better, as it can handle more complex tasks and create better results. Mobile video editing apps are often more limited in features and functionality. They also tend to be more difficult to use since the smaller screen size makes it harder to see the details of your work.
