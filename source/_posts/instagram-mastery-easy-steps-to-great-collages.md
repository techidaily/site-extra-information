There’s certainly a bit of a ‘trick’ to it Although, it’s not a very complicated one. Or, even, particularly hard to find. There are several methods that you can use as well. So, if you find that one isn’t working for you (or you’re looking for a very specific kind of aesthetic), then it might be helpful to have more than one or the other.

In this tutorial, we’ll be teaching you all of the different Instagram methods (as well as introducing some different third-party apps you can consider.)

## Part 1 **Easy Steps on Making a Collage on Instagram**

First, we’ll be showing you how to make the most basic **Instagram Story Collage** — or, a form of it anyway This is a quick one, but it might not be one that you’ve heard of before. Since it’s quite obscure, and the use is limited. To start off this tutorial, by the way, we’re heading straight to Insta Story

### 01**Step 1\. Open Modes**

First of all, open your Insta Story and open the Modes menu (usually found on the left-hand side of the screen.) You can play around with the features here or skip it entirely if you want the background to be an image.

### 02**Step 2\. Create Collage on Insta**

For the sake of simplicity, we’ll be making a basic **Instagram Story Collage** with a flat background. This is possible by clicking the ‘Create’ Mode (found at the very top of the side-menu on the left.)

![Create an Instagram Story Collage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/easy-trick-on-how-to-instagram-collage2.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Choose Images for Insta Story Collage**

Next, it’s time to add pictures. You can do this by selecting the ‘Camera Roll’ function on the bottom-left-hand corner of the screen.

### 05**Step 5\. Edit and Post Instagram Collage**

With this done, you can now edit and post your collage on your Instagram Story As you can see, the app automatically supplies a flat background that matches the look of your chosen images, so it’s quite useful

## Part 2 **Easy Steps on Making a Collage on Instagram Story Using the Layout Mode**

For the first method, we were mainly free-forming our **Instagram Collage**. The options were quite limited too. However, with this next method, which makes use of the ‘Layout’ Mode on Insta Story, you’ll be able to control the exact look of your **Instagram Collage** before posting it onto your Insta Story

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 02**Step 2\. Select Images from Camera Roll**

Like before, you have the option of taking live photographs or using ones that were already taken by picking them out from your camera roll.

For our purposes, we’ve decided to make our **Instagram Collage** from images that were already in our camera roll.

![Open Device Cameral Roll](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/easy-trick-on-how-to-instagram-collage7.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 03**Step 3\. Select Images One by One**

Unlike the previous method, you’ll have to select images one by one (so that you can specify the placement of each photograph.) So, expect to repeat this step a couple of times based on the layout you choose.

![Select Images for Instagram Collage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/easy-trick-on-how-to-instagram-collage8.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Edit and Post Collage on Instagram**

And so, we’ve finished teaching you how to make a **photo collage in Instagram** using ‘Layout’ Mode As you can see, once you’ve chosen all the images that you want, it’s ready for posting whenever you need it

## Part 3 **Trendy Apps to Create Collages for Instagram**

To finish things off, we’ll be introducing some **Instagram Collage App**s and other tools that you can use as an **Instagram Collage Maker** This list will be quite varied and is in no particular order. So, make sure to look through each one so that you can figure out which suits you the most (we guarantee that there should be something here for you)

### 01**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

Although primarily a video editing tool, Filmora manages to make its way into this list of ours for its well-stocked media library that you can use for creating quick **Insta Story collage**s.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 02**PicMonkey**

This next one is a premium photo editing tool that you can use online PicMonkey, as it’s called, is owned by ‘Shutterstock,’ which, again, makes it a great solution as a **collage maker for Instagram** simply for the benefit of having a media library right at your grasp. Of course, the fact that it is a premium software may douse your enthusiasm a bit, but nothing is wrong with at least checking out the FREE trial to get you ahead.

![PicMonkey by Collage for Instagram Collages](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/easy-trick-on-how-to-instagram-collage11.png)

### 03**Canva**

Canva is a popular online photo editing tool that is used by many freelancers on the web. Just like both Filmora and PicMonkey, it comes with a built-in media library that you can use as a resource for creating your **Instagram Collage**s. Simple projects should be more than fine with the basic FREE version (though you might want to try Canva Pro regardless just to see the benefits of it firsthand.)

Layout should already be familiar to you from our previous tutorial But you might be surprised to know that this **Instagram Collage Maker** is actually available as its own stand-alone app. It’s totally legitimate and works exactly like the ‘Layout Mode’ that you see on your Instagram story. So, there’s no reason not to try it if you want a separate place to do your collage-making before posting it on your Insta Story.

## Part 2 **Easy Steps on Making a Collage on Instagram Story Using the Layout Mode**

For the first method, we were mainly free-forming our **Instagram Collage**. The options were quite limited too. However, with this next method, which makes use of the ‘Layout’ Mode on Insta Story, you’ll be able to control the exact look of your **Instagram Collage** before posting it onto your Insta Story

### 01**Step 1\. Open Layout Mode**

To start off, select ‘Layout’ mode from the side-menu on the left.

### 02**Step 2\. Select Images from Camera Roll**

Like before, you have the option of taking live photographs or using ones that were already taken by picking them out from your camera roll.

For our purposes, we’ve decided to make our **Instagram Collage** from images that were already in our camera roll.

### 03**Step 3\. Select Images One by One**

Unlike the previous method, you’ll have to select images one by one (so that you can specify the placement of each photograph.) So, expect to repeat this step a couple of times based on the layout you choose.

## Part 1 **Easy Steps on Making a Collage on Instagram**

First, we’ll be showing you how to make the most basic **Instagram Story Collage** — or, a form of it anyway This is a quick one, but it might not be one that you’ve heard of before. Since it’s quite obscure, and the use is limited. To start off this tutorial, by the way, we’re heading straight to Insta Story

### 01**Step 1\. Open Modes**

First of all, open your Insta Story and open the Modes menu (usually found on the left-hand side of the screen.) You can play around with the features here or skip it entirely if you want the background to be an image.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 02**Step 2\. Select Images from Camera Roll**

Like before, you have the option of taking live photographs or using ones that were already taken by picking them out from your camera roll.

For our purposes, we’ve decided to make our **Instagram Collage** from images that were already in our camera roll.

### 03**Step 3\. Select Images One by One**

Unlike the previous method, you’ll have to select images one by one (so that you can specify the placement of each photograph.) So, expect to repeat this step a couple of times based on the layout you choose.
