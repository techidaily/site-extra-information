**Step 1** – In your Periscope app, click the ‘Twitter icon’ before initiating a public broadcast. Make sure to keep the title of your broadcast short and crisp, as it consumes the Twitter character count.

**Step 2** – Now, the URL of your broadcast will get tweeted on your Twitter account. Viewers can tap that link and get re-directed to the Periscope broadcasting.

 Note: If you face any problem, then sign out from your Twitter account and re-login. Try again the above process.

## Part 3: Tips of having better broadcast experience

#### Selfie Stick

 For Periscope live streaming, you can undoubtedly go for a selfie stick, as it can solve your numerous shooting woes.

When they get the opportunity to take part in your broadcasts by commenting, asking questions, being answered, it positively impacts your purpose.

 There are ways to gain their confidence; either by a Q & A session after the broadcast or a live chat window alongside your broadcast to engage the audience. Create the curiosity to let them come back for the next live video streaming.
