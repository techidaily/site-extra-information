## Pros and Cons of Nano Drones

**Pros:**

* As these drones are available with small price range so they suit budget ranges of all beginners. Such low price devices can help them to learn flight control mechanism with ease because it is not advisable to start directly with heavily priced units.
* If they crash, they are going to suffer minimum damage and will keep the situation out of trouble.
* Nano drones possess overall weight of nine ounces so users need not to follow the formalities to register them with FAA.
* They take very less time to charge as they hold smaller battery units.
**Cons**
* Nano Drones suffer with lack of professional camera lenses because these lenses use to be very heavy and a compact drone unit such as nano version cannot carry this weight in air.
* Mini drones are not able to ensure rich quality of recorded footage; you might have to make few compromises regarding resolution level and footage stability.
* These devices are equipped with very small batteries due to their compact size so they are able to spend less time in air as batteries get discharged fast.
