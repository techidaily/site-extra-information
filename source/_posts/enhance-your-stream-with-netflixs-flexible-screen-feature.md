## Enhance Your Stream with Netflix's Flexible Screen Feature

Video and movie **streaming** has become a common amenity in modern life. Because of **apps**, watching a series or a movie can be done with only a few taps. You can now bake a cake or iron your clothes while watching something on **Netflix**. But did you know that you can also do this kind of multitasking on your device? Anything is possible with the Netflix **picture-in-picture** feature.

Android users have long enjoyed the use of a floating window on their devices. And now, this function is available for iOS users as well. The picture-in-picture function involves a floating window that can be resized and moved across the screen. You can comfortably text, mail, or browse the internet while comfortably watching a video on Netflix. Here is the ultimate guide to using the feature across different platforms.

## Part 1\. How to Enable Picture-in-Picture on Netflix on Desktop

### PiP on Mac

Mac differs from Windows in the sense that it doesn't have an actual app for Netflix. Instead, you can watch your videos by using the web browser.

The picture-in-picture feature is available if you are using the Google Chrome browser. If you're using a Linux or Windows computer, you can also work with the following method.

1. First, launch **Google Chrome** on your device.
1. Open [**com**](https://www.netflix.com/) and select a movie or show.
1. Once the video is played, click the **media control button**. This can be found in the top right corner of the Chrome window.
1. Upon clicking it, a popup window will appear. Select the **"Picture in Picture" button**, positioned at the bottom right corner.
