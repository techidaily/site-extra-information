Do you still type to organize meeting minutes or song lyrics after you have recorded them using Voice Memos? This requires a lot of effort and takes a lot of time. Being able to directly convert voice to text will significantly increase your productivity. Here we have introduced useful methods on 3 platforms to transcribe voice to text.

### On iPhone

**[Transcribe - Speech to Text](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/transcribe-speech-to-text/id1241342461?platform=iphone)**

Transcribe – Speech to text is one of the best apps to convert your voice into text using an iPhone. It offers excellent AI conversion with easy-to-use interface.

Instead of typing, you can speak your content directly. There is no time limit for dictation. Voice Memos can be translated into any language and converted to text by Dictation – Speech to text.
