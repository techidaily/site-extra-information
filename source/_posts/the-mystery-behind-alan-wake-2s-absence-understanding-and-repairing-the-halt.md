Luckily, most of these required files can be downloaded and installed via Windows Update. So you should make sure that you have the latest available updates installed:

1. On your keyboard, hit the**Windows** key, then type**check for update** s, then click C**heck for updates** .

 Then try to play your game via Paradox Launcher again to see if it can launch. If the problem remains, please move on to the next fix.

## 4\. Modify your antivirus program settings

 Windows Defender, or a third-party antivirus program, could mistake your Paradox Launcher as a threat, as it usually consumes a lot of memory and CPU usage when a game is running. To make sure that your antivirus program is not the culprit to the Paradox Launcher not working problem, here are two things that you can do:

### 4.1 Add Steam and the game to the antivirus exception list

 Third-party antivirus applications hook very deep into your system, so it may interfere with Steam and Paradox Launcher. To avoid this problem, you can try   **adding both Steam and Paradox Launcher as exceptions to your third-party antivirus application** .

 If you’re not sure how to do it, please consult your antivirus documentation for further instructions.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### 4.2 Make sure bootstrapper-v2.exe is not flagged as a virus

 It was reported by some users that their antivirus program accidentally flagged**bootstrapper-v2.exe** as a virus or PUA (potentially unwanted application), and thus with the Paradox Launcher not working problem.

 In this case, the fix is rather straightforward, just restore bootstrapper-v2.exe from the quarantine section in your anvirus program.

 If Windows Defender is marking this file as a potential threat, you can do the following to restore the file:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and type**windows security** . Then select**Windows Security** from the list.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-7.png)
2. Select**Virus & Threat protection** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9.png)
3. Under**Current threats** , select**Protection history** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-10.png)
4. If you can see**bootstrapper-v2.exe** or other Paradox Launcher-related services and programs here, click the**Actions** button and select**Restore** .
