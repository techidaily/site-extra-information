## Part 1: What is the Standard Size for Videos on LinkedIn?

Before we provide solutions to download LinkedIn videos, it is important to cover some basics. Ideally, if you want to deal with videos on LinkedIn, then you should be familiar with their overall requirements.

As of now, LinkedIn does not have too many requirements for uploading a video. You can upload any horizontal or vertical video on LinkedIn of a maximum 5GB size. The uploaded video has to be at least 3-second long and can’t exceed10 minutes.

![linkedin video size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/linkedin-video-size.jpg)

These are all the other requirements that you must follow to upload videos on LinkedIn.

* Video size: 75KB to 5GB
* Orientation: Horizontal and vertical (but vertical videos would be cropped to a square-fit).
* Video Resolution: From 256×144 to 4096×2304
* Aspect ratio: 2.4:1 or 1:2.4
* Frame rate: 10 to 60 fps
* Bit rate: 192kbps to 30mbps
* Supported Formats: AVI, FLV, MP4, WebM, VP9, VP8, and more.

## Part 3: Does Video Content Marketing Work on LinkedIn?

It should not sound surprising, but the brands that use video content to market their products get more leads compared to other companies. Therefore, just like any other platform, you should work on different video marketing strategies on LinkedIn as well.

#### 1.Keep your videos short yet effective

Unlike YouTube, you should try to keep your video content short and crisp on LinkedIn (as the maximum duration for videos is just 10 minutes on LinkedIn). Ideally, your motive is to inform your audience about a topic and add value. Therefore, you can talk about the subject directly and keep things crisp.

#### 2.Don’t ignore the thumbnail of your video

Your thumbnail would be the first thing that your audience would see before clicking on your LinkedIn video. That’s why you should try to come up with an enticing thumbnail that should attract others, but it should justify your video at the same time.

#### 3.Partner with other LinkedIn influencers

LinkedIn is all about expanding your professional network and you should consider doing the same with your videos. Apart from showcasing your work, you can host other people to increase cross-brand collaboration.

#### 4.Take care of captions and other content

Not just your video content, you should also focus on including an STR file or enable LinkedIn’s closed caption feature. Besides that, you can also come up with an engaging copy for your video content that would make your audience watch it instantly.

## Part 4: The Best LinkedIn Video Editor to Create Stunning Videos

As you can see, it is quite easy to do any LinkedIn video download for free. Though, if you want to upload some interesting video content on your LinkedIn page, then consider using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

LinkedIn is the most popular platform for professionals worldwide that certainly needs no introduction. While the platform is extensively used to expand our professional network, it also lets us share all kinds of pictures and videos on our pages.

Here, I will let you know how to download a video from LinkedIn by sharing 6 effective sources.

## Part 1: What is the Standard Size for Videos on LinkedIn?

Before we provide solutions to download LinkedIn videos, it is important to cover some basics. Ideally, if you want to deal with videos on LinkedIn, then you should be familiar with their overall requirements.

As of now, LinkedIn does not have too many requirements for uploading a video. You can upload any horizontal or vertical video on LinkedIn of a maximum 5GB size. The uploaded video has to be at least 3-second long and can’t exceed10 minutes.

![linkedin video size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/linkedin-video-size.jpg)

These are all the other requirements that you must follow to upload videos on LinkedIn.

* Video size: 75KB to 5GB
* Orientation: Horizontal and vertical (but vertical videos would be cropped to a square-fit).
* Video Resolution: From 256×144 to 4096×2304
* Aspect ratio: 2.4:1 or 1:2.4
* Frame rate: 10 to 60 fps
* Bit rate: 192kbps to 30mbps
* Supported Formats: AVI, FLV, MP4, WebM, VP9, VP8, and more.

## Part 2: Top 6 LinkedIn Video Downloaders (100% Free)

Out of all the available options, I would recommend using the following LinkedIn video downloader tools that can be accessed online.

To use it, you first have to go to the LinkedIn website or its app and look for a video to download. Once the video is loaded, you can go to the address bar to copy the URL or tap on the three-dot icon on its app to do the same.

## Part 3: Does Video Content Marketing Work on LinkedIn?

It should not sound surprising, but the brands that use video content to market their products get more leads compared to other companies. Therefore, just like any other platform, you should work on different video marketing strategies on LinkedIn as well.

#### 1.Keep your videos short yet effective

Unlike YouTube, you should try to keep your video content short and crisp on LinkedIn (as the maximum duration for videos is just 10 minutes on LinkedIn). Ideally, your motive is to inform your audience about a topic and add value. Therefore, you can talk about the subject directly and keep things crisp.

#### 2.Don’t ignore the thumbnail of your video

Your thumbnail would be the first thing that your audience would see before clicking on your LinkedIn video. That’s why you should try to come up with an enticing thumbnail that should attract others, but it should justify your video at the same time.

#### 3.Partner with other LinkedIn influencers

LinkedIn is all about expanding your professional network and you should consider doing the same with your videos. Apart from showcasing your work, you can host other people to increase cross-brand collaboration.

#### 4.Take care of captions and other content

Not just your video content, you should also focus on including an STR file or enable LinkedIn’s closed caption feature. Besides that, you can also come up with an engaging copy for your video content that would make your audience watch it instantly.

## Part 4: The Best LinkedIn Video Editor to Create Stunning Videos

As you can see, it is quite easy to do any LinkedIn video download for free. Though, if you want to upload some interesting video content on your LinkedIn page, then consider using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It is a user-friendly and AI-integrated [video editing tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that would let you come up with tons of interesting videos in no time.
