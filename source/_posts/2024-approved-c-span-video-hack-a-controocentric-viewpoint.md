Downloading videos from the internet is tricky, especially from sites like C-Span. Although the Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network provides you with access to the political process, you have to stream it online or pay a fee to purchase and download the video. What if you didn’t have the funds to buy so many videos? There’s a solution for you. Different apps allow you to download full-length videos of congressional floor debates, committee meetings, etc. In this article, we’ll provide you with various options you can utilize for downloading c-span videos; let’s take a look.

**What is C-Span?**

![download-c-span-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/download-c-span-video-2.jpg)

C-Span is a non-profit that has the sole purpose of providing public access to the political process. Through C-Span, the public can view congressional floor debates, hearings, and several more legislative sessions. C-Span was founded in 1979 by Brian Lamb and gets its profit from the cable industry rather than tax money. Although it started out showing sessions of the House of Representatives, C-Span later expanded with the development of additional channels.

One of C-Span’s most popular features is the call-in feature. C-Span broadcasts daily and occasionally covers the Canadian and British Parliament. It also tries to air proceedings from other governments which they believe are essential to their viewers. By 2010, C-Span was already available in over 100 million households.

C-Span doesn’t get its funding from the government, despite broadcasting sessions. Instead, the platform receives license fees from cable systems that provide their network to their customers. By providing unfettered video coverage of legislative proceedings, C-Span provides public figures with a channel they can reach the public with traditional media filters. A C-Span video averages 200MB for an hour if you’re going with the standard quality. However, for lower-quality versions of C-Span videos, you can get them at an average of 73MB for a full hour.

C-Span videos are available in MP4 formats because they’re the most compatible format with most video-playback apps and devices. In addition, C-Span allows its viewers to purchase physical DVDs to deliver through the mail, or it will enable you simply to pay for access to download the C-Span video.

**Ways to Download C-Span Video for Free**

**Final Thoughts**

C-Span videos are great if you would like to keep up with the political scene in the country. However, you might not always have the funds to download it. The various ways shared in this article allow you to download C-Span videos for free. You can also edit the videos using Wondershare Filmora. Utilize any of these methods and enjoy your C-Span videos offline.

Downloading videos from the internet is tricky, especially from sites like C-Span. Although the Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network provides you with access to the political process, you have to stream it online or pay a fee to purchase and download the video. What if you didn’t have the funds to buy so many videos? There’s a solution for you. Different apps allow you to download full-length videos of congressional floor debates, committee meetings, etc. In this article, we’ll provide you with various options you can utilize for downloading c-span videos; let’s take a look.

**What is C-Span?**

![download-c-span-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/download-c-span-video-2.jpg)

C-Span is a non-profit that has the sole purpose of providing public access to the political process. Through C-Span, the public can view congressional floor debates, hearings, and several more legislative sessions. C-Span was founded in 1979 by Brian Lamb and gets its profit from the cable industry rather than tax money. Although it started out showing sessions of the House of Representatives, C-Span later expanded with the development of additional channels.

One of C-Span’s most popular features is the call-in feature. C-Span broadcasts daily and occasionally covers the Canadian and British Parliament. It also tries to air proceedings from other governments which they believe are essential to their viewers. By 2010, C-Span was already available in over 100 million households.

C-Span doesn’t get its funding from the government, despite broadcasting sessions. Instead, the platform receives license fees from cable systems that provide their network to their customers. By providing unfettered video coverage of legislative proceedings, C-Span provides public figures with a channel they can reach the public with traditional media filters. A C-Span video averages 200MB for an hour if you’re going with the standard quality. However, for lower-quality versions of C-Span videos, you can get them at an average of 73MB for a full hour.

C-Span videos are available in MP4 formats because they’re the most compatible format with most video-playback apps and devices. In addition, C-Span allows its viewers to purchase physical DVDs to deliver through the mail, or it will enable you simply to pay for access to download the C-Span video.

**Ways to Download C-Span Video for Free**

There are various ways you can download C-Span videos for free. Below, we’ll mention two methods to download C-Span videos and the multiple apps you can use to achieve it.
