The podcasts available in the app were originally in Google Play Music. But after its discontinuation in 2020, the podcasts have moved to this separate platform. However, the links of the available shows and branding have become new, so it is important to update that information on your channel and transfer the audience there. As for this app itself, it is still ongoing.

## Part 2: Google Podcasts Features

Now that you know the Google Podcast platform, it is best to discuss the expected features. You can use the software to find different podcasts and listen to them, adding them to a queue or your library for later. New episodes and shows are always up in the recommendations.

**Subscriptions**

You can subscribe to different shows per the preferred **Genre** you want to listen to. Then, you will get updates on the new shows or posted episodes as notifications. Unsubscribing from the podcast is easy as well.
