## 1\. From Nothing

This movie has been developed with an inspiration from iconic inception scene where a architect use to fold buildings like a miracle. The video and audio both are created with unique style and from nothing appears to be the most gorgeous and well themed film on VR world. Christopher Libertino in this movie has developed mysteries so beautifully and it serves like a masterpiece in terms of graphic design; From Nothing actually represents the ending scopes and that is why it is rated as one of the highly popular program by all Oculus users.

Those who wish to watch this movie can visit [Oculus store](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/) or [Vrideo (Update: Vrideo is overshadowed by other VR platforms)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/457670/Vrideo/) for fast download and it can be enjoyed with Oculus device or VR gear.

## 2\. Surge

The rising sound of streams of falling flashing stones appears like awesome sunrise on an artificial but incredibly beautiful landscape designed by Stacaato. Once you go through the amazing audio tracks of Surge then your mind starts streaming with the harmony of sound of those shifting blocks or cubes and the vibrations on floor can be clearly observed. Surge is designed with open world type music video where so many things are available to explore along with outstanding virtual landscape. The rhythms synthetic track leads to wonderful VR experience for all users and it has potential to create powerful appearance even without any story. This is all due to quality of sound system that makes everything mesmerizing in this VR creation.

This movie is available to download at [Oculus store](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/) as well as at Kaleidoscope.

## 3\. Colosse

There is no doubt to say that traditional movies often bring viewers to observe main action over screen that contains few details about props with periphery. But this short film Colosse tells a story about spearfisher where major focus goes on a giant golem so ultimately VR allows you to watch anywhere without any prop specification needs. This open environment type film making style of VR allows viewers to enjoy everything even if they do not follow typical rules of script.

To watch this movie you can go to [Oculus store](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/) or Kaleidoscope festival.

## 4\. 11:57

Scary movies leading to terrible deaths at each step are difficult to watch but with VR production techniques the effect becomes highly terrifying as users have no option to get away from horrible scenes. 11:57 is same type of lead that makes 360 degree something more than a nightmare and the darkness will never let you stay stable on chair. The challenges faced by team during creation of this movie were explained by Henrik Leichsenring, the co-director of movie but the ultimate movie brings real challenges to viewers.
