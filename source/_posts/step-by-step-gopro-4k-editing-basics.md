**Step 2: Drag and Drop Videos in Order**

When all GoPro video files are in the editor, drag and drop them in a proper sequence, as you see while playing the video on the camera. However, you can also change the clips’ positions as needed.

Moreover, position chapters on the same track and adjust each clip side by side without leaving any gaps. You can always detach audio by right-clicking individual clips and selecting the ‘Detach Audio’ feature from the ‘Audio’ option.

**Step 3: Export Your Videos**

After you finish merging GoPro videos, click the ‘Export’ button to save the single video made from multiple clips on your system.

## **Conclusion**

There is no doubt to say that market is full of editing software for action camera videos. Whether you are a beginner or a professional, the editing software can provide you impressive results with few efforts. But when it comes to quality we cannot compromise and it is desired to pick the best software tool.
