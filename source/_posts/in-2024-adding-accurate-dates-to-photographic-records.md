Mac and windows have free image editing programs that allow you to copy an image from its source, paste it into the editor, crop it, resize it, and then save it. First, let's look at how to **edit a photo on a Mac.**

### Use the inbuilt photo on Mac to edit the photo

Drag and drop your image onto the app window after launching the built-in Images app from your dock or **Finder > Applications** to begin editing photos on your Mac.
