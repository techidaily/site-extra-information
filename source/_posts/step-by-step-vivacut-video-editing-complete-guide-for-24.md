### Export

Now at the end, we will discuss how we can export our edited videos from it. So we can do this by clicking on the Export button at the top right corner of our screen. In the next step, it will ask us in which quality we want to export our video. Now it's upon us whether we export it in 720p (HD) or 480p (SD). We can also export our videos in 1080p (FHD), but for this, we have to purchase the premium package of it.
