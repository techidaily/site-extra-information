| |  **Apple M1 Pro**   | **Intel Chips (i9)**                              |                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CPU**               | 10-core                                           | 10-core                                                                   |

| **Memory**            | 32 GB                                             | 16 GB                                                                     |
| **Performance**       | 1.7 times better CPU performance than Intel chips | Good performance for gaming, good processing speed, specific 3D rendering |

In terms of CPU performance, battery life, and technology design, there is not much difference between M1 Pro and Intel chips. Though in other areas, there seems to be a particular performance variance. It must say that both of the processors work well in their area.

As a user, you can go with any one of them as per your choice and need. As, both M1 Pro and Intel chips look good in terms of specification and performance.
