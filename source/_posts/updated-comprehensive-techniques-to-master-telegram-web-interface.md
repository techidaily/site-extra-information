## Part 1\. What Is Telegram?

Firstly, let's learn more about this useful tool we use every day for communication.

As to the Chrome extension, it is easy for you to install it in the browser by clicking the official link given above. In this article, we will focus on how to use Telegram in browser-based PC version conveniently.
