The video compression level can be also adjusted with ease by choosing high bit rates or normal mode.

 It is possible to record footage with Ghost S in high bit rate as well as in normal mode. The still quality is 12MP that offers crystal clear views. When you use normal bit rate at 1080p then edges of videos appear jagged and interlaced. But this issue can be slightly resolved with high bit rate settings.

 This camera consists of a Micro SDXC type card slot that can easily support cards up to 64 GB capacities. Other than this, your camera possesses Mini-HDMI ports, Mini-USB ports and a large size battery that can support long hour recording. With this big size battery you can easily record up to 3.5 hours with 1080p settings at 30fps frame rate. And if you go ahead with reduced resolution levels then it is possible to record for much longer duration.

#### **The Bottom Line:**

 There is no doubt to say that Drift Ghost S device comes with large screen and intuitive control options. You can also preview you footage before uploading it on any social media platform. Although this device is much costlier as compared to Ghost HD but at the same time possesses all incredible features as like impressive video recording modes.
