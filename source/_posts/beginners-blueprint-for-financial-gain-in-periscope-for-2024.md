#### 2\. Consistent Streaming

It is essential to maintain a consistent schedule while publishing content. What does that mean?

Keep the points you wish to include in your video handy and refer to it every now and then to have a clear picture of what you would like to say. But, do not make a video as if someone forced you to speak. Be natural and sporty.
