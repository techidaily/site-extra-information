### Step 4\. Add your Photo or Video to the 3D LUT Mobile app

3D LUT mobile lets you take a new photo using your phone camera or the ones from the gallery – A functionality not common in most editing applications. For this case, we will select an image from the gallery.

### Step 5\. Carry out Basic adjustments

Unedited videos and photos usually have some minor flaws. Usually, it is vital to correct the defects before indulging in applying LUTs. By correcting imperfections such as tone, brightness, shadows, or texture in your photo, you will be giving it that sparkling look before proceeding with the edits.

6. Regulate the color intensities of your image using the saturation functionality.
7. Set shadows in your image using “Black” functionality.
8. Darken the highlights and lighten the shadows using “Tone Mapping” functionality.
9. Regulate your image contrast using the “Texture” option.
10. Focus on the soft edges in your photo using ‘the” Sharpness” functionality.
11. Regulate noise in your video using the “Noise” feature.
12. Darken the corners of your image using the “Vignette” feature.

### Step 6\. Incorporate LUTs into your Project

Head over to the LUTs tab in your 3D LUT mobile. For convenience, you will notice that LUTs are arranged in folders. Some of the folders include; Editor’s Pick, Mobile Weekly, Grading, Black& White, Top25, and UsersUploads.

Hover through the folders, and once you find one that seems to suit your needs, open it. From the folder, there are various LUts. Navigate through the folder you have selected and match the LUTs with your project image.
