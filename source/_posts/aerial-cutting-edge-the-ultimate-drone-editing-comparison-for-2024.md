### 3\. How do I transfer videos from my DJI Go app to my computer?

You can do this in various ways. An easy way is to take the help of the memory card installed in the camera.

You can simply take it out and plug it with the computer (Mac or Windows), and you are good to go.

Make sure to save the videos in directory/DCIM/100MEDIA and then copy the files from this folder on your PC.
