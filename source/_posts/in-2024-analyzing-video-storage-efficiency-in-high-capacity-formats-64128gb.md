## Analyzing Video Storage Efficiency in High-Capacity Formats (64/128GB)

Memory cards and storage devices come in many sizes, just as grocery store bags come in various sizes for transporting customers' food, and each user will choose which size to purchase. Each user will consider various criteria while making this decision, including the size of the videos they intend to save on the SD card.

## How much video can 64GB hold?

Based on the normal video resolution of 4k at 60fps, a 64GB storage device can keep more than 1 hour and 20 minutes of video time.

A 64GB storage device can hold more than 1 hour and 37 minutes of video at a resolution of 2.7k at 120fps. On a 64GB memory card, recording at a resolution of 1080p at 60fps allows for around 5 hours of video time.

## How much video can 128GB hold?

A 128GB memory card may carry about 75 or 76 videos if each film is only 3 minutes long.

The data rate of movies is generally influenced by the format and codec of the videos. When this happens, the time it takes for a memory card of that capacity to fill up can be affected. A normal 128GB memory card should be able to hold up to 24 hours of video at 1080p HD. That data rate must be 8.85MB/s for this to happen.

A normal 128GB memory card should be able to hold up to 24 hours of footage at 1080p at 4k resolution. That data rate must be 8.85MB/s for this to happen. A standard 128GB memory card can hold up to 48 hours of film at 720p at 4k resolution. A data rate of roughly 4.42MB/s is also required.

 Baseline Profile is a decent choice in general. This format will most likely shrink your video without losing too much quality.

As you can see, there are a variety of compression settings. Feel free to experiment with some of them to see how small they can make your file. The  baseline is your best bet in general.

**Step 3: Adjust the resolution and Export the file.**

You can change the resolution or aspect ratio variables to change the video's size.

![64gb-128gb-hold-video-size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/64gb-128gb-hold-video-size-7.jpg)

Compatibility: Online

If you don't want to install or use an app on your computer, many websites will allow you to submit a video file and compress it for you. Some of these services demand registration, others charge a monthly fee (or place a watermark on your movie), and others are free and only require a video file.

VEED.IO is the first service we'll look at. VEED provides a simple video compression tool for free as part of its video editing tools. It works on both Windows and Mac, and it runs entirely within your browser, so no software is required.

**Step 1: Import file:**

Open the web browser and open the veed.io video compressor. Import the video file by clicking on 'Upload a file.'

**Step 2: Compress the file.**

Once your video file is uploaded, you will see the file compressing options on the screen. You can compress the file to the size that you want.

It is to note that the video file size can be reduced to half depending on the length and quality of the video.

**Step 3: Compress and export the file.**

Click on 'Compress file' and wait until the video file is compressed to your preferred size. You can export the file by sharing the video link or downloading the video on your device.

Note: The compression time might vary depending on the quality and size of the file. Also, you might have to compromise on video quality to compress the video file using veed.io.
