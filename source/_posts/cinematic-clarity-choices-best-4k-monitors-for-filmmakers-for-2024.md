### Things Need to Know Before Buying a 4K Monitor for Video Editing

You will find unlimited monitor designs in market but it is important to check few major specifications while buying a new one for your 4K video editing needs. It should match the resolution standards. There are generally two major terms that we follow in this category:

* First one is DCI 4K that deals with 4096x2160 pixels while maintaining 256:135 aspect ratio. This is the most commonly followed standard in film industry.
* Second is UHD-1 that we often call as 4K for TV productions. It delivers 3840x2160 resolution level with 16:9 aspect ratio.

Most of the cameras these days are designed with UHD 4K abilities because it brings impressive results for YouTube posts. When these videos are accessed on 16:9 screen, there are no black bars on top or bottom portion of the screen.
