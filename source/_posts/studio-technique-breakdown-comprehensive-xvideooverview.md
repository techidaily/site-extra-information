**X Video Editor app** is an Android-exclusive app that has the ability to create more spectacular and captivating videos. The app has an easy-to-use and simple interface and comes with all the major video editing tools, such as effects, filters, and themes.

Another exciting feature of the X app is its built-in music library, which lets you choose from a wide range of music to add to your video. You can also add your own music, photos, and effects to personalize your video.
