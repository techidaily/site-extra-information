Creating picture-in-picture videos can be one of the best ways that you can make reaction videos or play-by-play videos showcasing yourself on camera as well as action happening in the main video.

This type of video has become extremely popular on YouTube and other video sharing websites. If you are interested in breaking into this medium, it becomes much easier with the help of the macOS Sierra update. Through the improvements with this new operating system and extremely high demand for picture-in-picture videos, users are finding it much simpler to create this style of video.

In order to create professional picture-in-picture videos, you're going to need access to an editing suite. Having a professional **PIP video editor** can be one of the best ways to edit together a picture-in-picture video and add in some of your own effects in the process.

![move picture in picture](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/move-pip.jpg)

Once you are comfortable with the viewing area that you would like to playback, put the videos on top of each other in a picture-in-picture style, and have them play at the same time.

This picture-in-picture format is like a video overlay, and you can take out the area where the second video will play and sync it up with the main video too.

Once you are comfortable with how the videos play in relation to each other, where the video tracks are located and more, you can work at saving the film.

Once you are comfortable with the viewing area that you would like to playback, put the videos on top of each other in a picture-in-picture style, and have them play at the same time.

This picture-in-picture format is like a video overlay, and you can take out the area where the second video will play and sync it up with the main video too.

Once you are comfortable with how the videos play in relation to each other, where the video tracks are located and more, you can work at saving the film.
