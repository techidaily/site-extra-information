Production costs like the length, concept, location, and the actions you would like to take in the video can significantly change the cost. Additionally, you have to factor in the extra costs like crew, casts, transportation, feeding, etc. However, if you want a music video professionally edited from start to finish, Wondershare Filmora doesn’t just help you cut costs; it also ensures you get an enhanced music video result at the end.</p><p>The music production scene has significantly changed in the last decade. The amount of music and videos being made is much higher than ever. Due to this, the budget range is quite broad and can be quite confusing for first-timers. Although some people use record labels to pay for their music videos, others pay out-of-pocket.</p><p>When shooting a music video, you have to recognize that a lot goes into shooting the music video. It goes beyond the artist and includes the crew members who would show up to make it happen. There are also different aspects to consider when determining how much you need to shoot a music video. Luckily, we’re here to break down how much it will cost to shoot a music video for you. Then, you can use the information shared here to start planning your next music video.</p><p><strong>How Much Will It Cost to Shoot a Music Video?</strong></p><p>We’re noticing a shift in the music video category, with more people choosing to release video singles over audio singles. Additionally, several video-sharing platforms encourage artists to share and promote themselves in creative ways. However, how much will it cost to shoot a music video? Below is how you can determine the answer to that.</p><p><strong>Creating a Budget</strong></p><p>The budget for your music video usually covers pre-production, concept development, casting, storyboards, choreography, location fee, rehearsal, production equipment, on-camera talent, props, costumes, post-production, editing, and many more. For a professional video, you can budget anywhere from $20,000 to $500,000. Sometimes, it costs even more, depending on the concept you’re looking to achieve.</p><p>However, if you have a lower budget, you would have to forego the inclusion of high-end visual effects, expensive locations, and many more. However, you can still creatively convey your story even with a low budget.</p><p><strong>Estimated Production Costs</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/music-video-cost-2.jpg"                      alt="music-video-cost"                ></p><p>For an artist looking for a lower budget, the estimated cost of production for a day can range from $500 to $1,500. This usually depends on your location and the permits you need. There might be extras along the way, but this is the average amount to budget per day.</p><p>If you are shooting scenes in different outfits, you might also have to budget rental fees. This could significantly increase the cost of production, even without the inclusion of more factors like transportation and food during the shooting process. However, these are important because they determine how your video looks at the end. In addition, good locations can sometimes be pricey, and you might want to get a stylist for your wardrobe.</p><p>Additionally, artists have to consider the cost of production equipment. If you want professional options like a 4k camera and lighting kits, it will drastically increase the average production cost because they cost a lot to rent and maintain. However, you should note that the better the equipment, the higher the cost.</p><p><strong>Estimated Production Days</strong></p><p>Depending on the concept and storyboard of your video, it usually takes 2-3 days to edit your video after production. Sometimes, the editor’s fee determines how much editing will be carried out on your video. What makes up the cost of post-production includes the storage device for your video and the hourly cost of your editor. For example, if your editor would be using advanced visual effects, they could charge between 70-150 dollars for each hour. Colorists are also part of the post-production cost, and their fee usually depends on the final product quality you would like to achieve.</p><p><strong>Additional Costs</strong></p><p>Apart from production and post-production costs, there are several more costs you need to consider. These costs are essential because they help to make your video come together. One of the additional costs to consider is the cast and crew. A fantastic music video requires talented people. This could range from 7 to 30 people at the location. Sometimes it could be. It is hard to determine the cost of the cast and crew because while some people work on day rates, others accept payment at the end of a project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/music-video-cost-3.jpg"                      alt="music-video-cost"                ></p><p>You should also consider the cost of food as everyone has to be in the best state to shoot the music video.

Subscriber trust creator’s opinions and can learn about new products in just a few minutes. Branded content and sponsored video are a great way to make additional revenue from your YouTube sponsor and grow your YouTube channel. As long as you have an engaged audience, its possible to secure sponsored content opportunities on YouTube.</p><p>Most content creator rely on sponsorship to make money from YouTube these days. The good news is that even if you have small channel this is still an option that’s available to you.</p><p>In this article, we’ll tell you exactly how to get sponsored on YouTube.</p><h2 id="What-is-Sponsored-video"><a href="#What-is-Sponsored-video" class="headerlink" title="What is Sponsored video"></a>What is Sponsored video</h2><p>Product sponsorship are when a brand sends you a free product to review. Product reviews are often the first sponsorship type a creator experience. Paid sponsorships are the highest level of YouTube sponsorship, you promote product or service on your channel in exchange for payment. They’re more likely to come your way once you’ve started to grow your channel.</p><p>Youtubers collaborate or accept sponsorship with the brand that fit their channel genre and personal interest so the sponsored videos resonate with their subscriber and target audience.</p><h2 id="Ways-to-Have-Sponsored-Product"><a href="#Ways-to-Have-Sponsored-Product" class="headerlink" title="Ways to Have Sponsored Product"></a>Ways to Have Sponsored Product</h2><h3 id="Focus-on-your-content"><a href="#Focus-on-your-content" class="headerlink" title="Focus on your content"></a>Focus on your content</h3><p>Given that you created now your YouTube channel, make sure to make a video that focus on what your niche or content. Think about what companies and products would be the most relevant, enjoyable, and valuable to your viewers. Example you like to talk about skin care products. Make sure that at least your first 10 videos focus about skin care. Or maybe make a video that relatable to everyone, but if you want products sponsorships do some products review on your channel. You will find your target audience if your consistent on the video you are creating. Products sponsors may come your way if you are consistent even if you have small audience or subscribers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/focus-on-video-content.jpg"                      alt="focus on video content"                ></p><h3 id="Invest-in-your-video"><a href="#Invest-in-your-video" class="headerlink" title="Invest in your video"></a>Invest in your video</h3><p>I personally, before the brand noticed my channel, i invested in products that i will review on my channel. I buy to try and do a review because i know someday this brand will noticed or watch my video and in this way i also got a chance to practice my speaking skills in front of the camera. If you are just starting this career, no one will come right away to sponsor you, so you need to make a way to get noticed and this is one way for you to be able to have a product sponsorship.</p><p>Essentially, you should think of your channel as your portfolio that brands will see before deciding to collaborate. The more professional your channel looks, the more opportunities you could have.</p><p>Don’t rush everything or you’re get tired right away. the first thing you have to do is make a hard effort to create quality content so that your channel will stand out from others. Remember there are a lot of content creator doing the same products review. The only thing you will do is make your own style and make sure you’re not copying others.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/invest-in-your-video.jpg"                      alt="invest in your video"                ></p><h3 id="Reach-out-to-Brands"><a href="#Reach-out-to-Brands" class="headerlink" title="Reach out to Brands"></a>Reach out to Brands</h3><p>The best way to get a sponsorship, especially for products reviewing, is by reaching out to the brands.</p><p>You can make an email and send it to the target brand but make sure you created a personalized email. Always do research about the brand and if possible, create a video that you are using or reviewing their products. Some brands are more likely to offer a sponsorship to creator who are using their products.</p><p>Make a sponsorship proposal to offer a business with the brand, include in the letter the benefits of the brand on sponsoring on you channel, give them the positive output and an eagerness that you can help them increase their sales by doing a product review on your channel. But make sure that all Brand you’re reaching out is the brand you tried and tested. Don’t ever collaborate to the brand that you don’t like to.</p><p>You should already have several videos on your channel before you approach brands, and it’s important to demonstrate that you have a consistent posting schedule. Brand want to get their products and services in front of potential buyers, so you’ll need to show that your videos have views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/reach-out-to-brands.jpg"                      alt="reach out to brands"                ></p><h3 id="Contact-Information"><a href="#Contact-Information" class="headerlink" title="Contact Information"></a>Contact Information</h3><p>Don’t forget to always put your contact information in each of your video, you can use the description box to put your contact details like your, email address, Facebook account page, Instagram account where they can direct message you and your other social media. Just put all information where brand can contact you in case, they want to offer you a products collaboration or sponsorships. Often</p><h3 id="Make-Stand-out-Video"><a href="#Make-Stand-out-Video" class="headerlink" title="Make Stand out Video"></a>Make Stand out Video</h3><p>There is brand that watch the videos of their target content creator, especially when you email them about sponsorships, they watch your video first before doing business with you. That is why It is essential that you create a high-quality video that will attract more sponsorship. Just add some good element, transition and effects on your video that make attractive and creative. But as a beginner not all are good in editing that is why we would like to recommend <strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong> video editing software for your video editing.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> actually user-friendly software, you can add stock footage from its media library, you can easily add video effects with a lot of advance editing tools like, effects, transition, color and tittles.

These videos show the benefits of a particular idea, product, or service with the help of concise text, infographics, appropriate narration, and images. In the business sphere, video presentations are used for everything – from marketing and increasing sales to B2B interactions and training employees.</p><p>Video presentations are used by businesses as a solution for video marketing on various channels, including email newsletters and social media.

Opt for Video presentations. Being much more appealing and interesting than regular cut-and-dry presentations, videos can deliver results. Some of the many benefits of using videos in your presentations are:</p><h4 id="1-Captures-People’s-Attention"><a href="#1-Captures-People’s-Attention" class="headerlink" title="1.  Captures People’s Attention"></a>1.  Captures People’s Attention</h4><p>Video presentations can grab the attention of the audience immediately. Videos offer you a delightful way to treat the audience, thus bringing your message to life in a way no other medium can. By incorporating interactive video presentation ideas, you can improve the viewer’s experience as well as utilize sound and sight to reel the audience in.</p><h4 id="2-Persuasive"><a href="#2-Persuasive" class="headerlink" title="2.  Persuasive"></a>2.  Persuasive</h4><p>Creating engaging video presentations can be a great way to persuade your target audience. Provoking emotional responses by incorporating audio-visual storytelling, adding sounds and sights into the mix, and bringing emotions can help you persuade your audience.</p><h4 id="3-Accessible-Anytime-Anywhere"><a href="#3-Accessible-Anytime-Anywhere" class="headerlink" title="3.  Accessible Anytime, Anywhere"></a>3.  Accessible Anytime, Anywhere</h4><p>People nowadays love spending time on their phones and tablets and so they prefer watching videos on them. This makes video presentations accessible anywhere, anytime. And with people becoming more reliant on technology at large, consider embracing videos to have a greater impact on viewers.</p><h4 id="4-Time-Efficient"><a href="#4-Time-Efficient" class="headerlink" title="4.  Time Efficient"></a>4.  Time Efficient</h4><p>Video presentations are specifically meant to allow the presenter to break down the information into smaller chunks. This way, viewers can digest larger amounts of information easily and quickly. Making video presentations can thus be a more time-effective decision.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-presentation-time-efficient.jpg"                      alt="Video Presentation Time Efficient"                ></p><h2 id="12-Creative-Video-Presentation-Ideas-to-Wow-Your-Audience"><a href="#12-Creative-Video-Presentation-Ideas-to-Wow-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="12 Creative Video Presentation Ideas to Wow Your Audience"></a>12 Creative Video Presentation Ideas to Wow Your Audience</h2><h4 id="1-Start-With-A-Provocative-Statement"><a href="#1-Start-With-A-Provocative-Statement" class="headerlink" title="1.  Start With A Provocative Statement"></a>1.  Start With A Provocative Statement</h4><p>Making a provocative statement when presenting your video can grab the attention of your audience right from the get-go. When your statement offers something a little controversial or maybe a bit offensive and unexpected, it makes people sit up and take notice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-presentation-provocative-statement.jpg"                      alt="Video Presentation Provocative Statement"                ></p><p><em>“People don’t care about your brand.”</em> Reading this, anyone will be compelled to see how the presenter justifies his&#x2F;her point, isn’t it? The video begins with an unpredicted statement, explains why, and later shows what needs to be done for overcoming the hurdle.</p><h4 id="2-Narrate-a-Story"><a href="#2-Narrate-a-Story" class="headerlink" title="2.  Narrate a Story"></a>2.  Narrate a Story</h4><p>One of the most interesting video presentation ideas to grab your audience’s attention is telling a story that evokes their emotions. Narrating a personal story can work wonders as the audience can relate to it on an individual level. Think about some stand-out examples of human stories that relate to your business so that people can connect with the central character.</p><p>Here, Nike – one of the top brands in the world encourages women around the world to fulfill their dreams. Be it gender inequality or playing soccer, it asks women to do what they want.</p><h4 id="3-Ask-Questions-or-Have-a-Q-A-Session"><a href="#3-Ask-Questions-or-Have-a-Q-A-Session" class="headerlink" title="3.  Ask Questions or Have a Q&amp;A Session"></a>3.  Ask Questions or Have a Q&amp;A Session</h4><p>Do you wish to get the audience involved? Ask questions right away! Questions and Q&amp;A sessions break up the regular presentation rhythm and help in marking whatever you say as important. This way, you can turn your presentation from a boring activity into an active quest that your audience loves exploring on their own through answers.</p><h4 id="4-Use-Visual-Metaphors"><a href="#4-Use-Visual-Metaphors" class="headerlink" title="4.  Use Visual Metaphors"></a>4.  Use Visual Metaphors</h4><p>Texts are less memorable and combining visuals with your message can help you grab the attention of the audience during your presentation. Visual metaphors are an excellent way to use images. In fact, visual images of situations that people are already familiar with help retain points much longer in their memory.</p><h4 id="5-Add-Music"><a href="#5-Add-Music" class="headerlink" title="5.  Add Music"></a>5.  Add Music</h4><p>Music has the power to enhance and support emotions in video presentations, as well as proven to sustain the attention of people and help in information retention. As per the <a class="link"   href="https://www.ronberk.com/articles/2011%5Fresearch.pdf" >research <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of The John Hopkins University’s Ronald A. Berk, <em>“Music embedded throughout a PowerPoint presentation can sustain attention while slipping the content into long-term memory.”</em> Incorporating music is one of the most amazing video presentation ideas you can take inspiration from.</p><h4 id="6-Break-It-Up-With-Humorous-Memes"><a href="#6-Break-It-Up-With-Humorous-Memes" class="headerlink" title="6.  Break It Up With Humorous Memes"></a>6.  Break It Up With Humorous Memes</h4><p>You’ve seen memes everywhere and you might even be sick of them. But, that doesn’t mean memes cannot be useful. In fact, using memes strategically can not only make your audience laugh but also surprise them.</p><h4 id="7-Add-Motion-Graphics"><a href="#7-Add-Motion-Graphics" class="headerlink" title="7.  Add Motion Graphics"></a>7.  Add Motion Graphics</h4><p>Motion graphics are an excellent way to illustrate an innovative idea with animated objects. When you add motion graphics in your presentation, it captures people’s attention instantly.</p><p>The video above shows how you can use motion graphics on the English alphabets.</p><h4 id="8-Use-Quotes-between-Slides"><a href="#8-Use-Quotes-between-Slides" class="headerlink" title="8.  Use Quotes between Slides"></a>8.  Use Quotes between Slides</h4><p>Quotes can be great breathers between groups of informative slides. You can either use quotes to start new sections of information or to separate ideas inside your video presentation. Make sure that the quotes you are using represent the topic of your presentation. This way, you can be confident they will make complete sense and not leave the viewers confused.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-quotes-between-slides.jpg"                      alt="Quotes between Slides"                ></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> &lt;<a href="http://www.behance.net>">www.behance.net&gt;</a></p><h4 id="9-Add-an-Audio-Narration"><a href="#9-Add-an-Audio-Narration" class="headerlink" title="9.  Add an Audio Narration"></a>9.  Add an Audio Narration</h4><p>No matter how long or short your presentation is, narration can give it a completely different mood, especially if the words are heartfelt and the voice is powerful. Use the voice to change the pace or tone of your presentation and it will keep the audience to your video. Furthermore, adding an audio narrative into your slideshow can be an excellent way to create an interactive presentation experience.</p><h4 id="10-Play-with-Animations-and-Transitions"><a href="#10-Play-with-Animations-and-Transitions" class="headerlink" title="10.  Play with Animations and Transitions"></a>10.  Play with Animations and Transitions</h4><p>One of the greatest advantages of videos over the standard presentations is that you can do all kinds of trendy things. Animations and transitions can pull your audience in and help you bring focus to crucial areas and ensure that viewers engage with you. Video content lets you condense complex ideas in seconds, the video below from <a class="link"   href="https://www.yumyumvideos.com/" >Yum Yum Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> shows how to deliver messages in a compelling and empathetic way with explainer videos.</p><h4 id="11-Turn-Your-Slides-into-a-Scrolling-Infographic"><a href="#11-Turn-Your-Slides-into-a-Scrolling-Infographic" class="headerlink" title="11.  Turn Your Slides into a Scrolling Infographic"></a>11.  Turn Your Slides into a Scrolling Infographic</h4><p>Line up your slides vertically for creating a scrolling infographic rather than a classic slide by slide transition presentation. When the viewer scrolls down, the information fills every slide progressively. In fact, this technique is ideal for displaying video presentations online.</p><h4 id="12-End-On-A-Meaningful-Strong-Note"><a href="#12-End-On-A-Meaningful-Strong-Note" class="headerlink" title="12.  End On A Meaningful &amp; Strong Note"></a>12.  End On A Meaningful &amp; Strong Note</h4><p>Looking for unique video presentation ideas that appeal to the audience? Your presentation will give you a lasting positive impression only if you end it right. It’s crucial to let the audience know what you want them to do next – visit a website, ponder an idea, or to take action towards a definite goal.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-Visually-Striking-Video-Presentations"><a href="#How-to-Create-Visually-Striking-Video-Presentations" class="headerlink" title="How to Create Visually Striking Video Presentations?"></a>How to Create Visually Striking Video Presentations?</h2><p>Wondershare Filmora is a powerful video editing software that’s used for creating video attention-grabbing video presentations.

Our today’s topic is exciting as it’s how you can <strong>write a good documentary script</strong> for your documentary video or film. As all of us know, the script is fundamental for any screenplay as it contains all the dialogues and instructions for the actors in written form. So that’s why it is also essential for your audio or video documentaries. That’s the reason why we are going to discuss this topic here today how you can be able to write effectively.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Literary Style</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Shot-Oriented</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Shooting Script</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How to make your own movie</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">Ensure the authenticity of the story</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-2">Define the key issues</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-3">Highlight the characteristics of the scene</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-4">Visual Writing</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-5">Guaranteed documentary viewing (Rhythm)</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-6">Fully researched</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Documentary script examples</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Make your documentary script come true by using Filmora</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Documentary"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Documentary" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is a Documentary?"></a>Part 1. What is a Documentary?</h2><p>To write a good documentary script, you should first know what a documentary is. A documentary is a genre usually used for non-fiction or reality-based films. Such type of films includes researched based representation of a specific subject like interviews of peoples involved in it, official documents related to it, and many more. Sometimes they tell us facts about a particular topic that only very few of us know. They are also beneficial to raising social issues to the officials and making others aware of them. Now that you know what a documentary is let’s move forward to our next step, three popular types of documentary scripts.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Three-popular-types-of-a-documentary-script"><a href="#Part-2-Three-popular-types-of-a-documentary-script" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Three popular types of a documentary script"></a>Part 2. Three popular types of a documentary script</h2><h3 id="1-Literary-Style"><a href="#1-Literary-Style" class="headerlink" title="1. Literary Style"></a>1. Literary Style</h3><p>In this style, your only concerns are with the shooting ability of the text for which you should have camera sense, writing rhetorically (but not too much) with the text language literacy, and dividing the script into different paragraphs according to time space and scene. You don’t have to describe the technical requirements of shooting in it.</p><h3 id="2-Shot-Oriented"><a href="#2-Shot-Oriented" class="headerlink" title="2. Shot-Oriented"></a>2. Shot-Oriented</h3><p>In this one, you have to write a detailed description of the action and the images which will be there in your screenplay without considering the script’s literary merits and readability. Also, in this style, each scene is divided into paragraphs, and before starting each section, the writer should have mentioned the scene’s location, time, mirror, and number. In simple words, this script style provides more detailed and deep instructions about the film or a documentary screenplay.</p><h3 id="3-Shooting-Script"><a href="#3-Shooting-Script" class="headerlink" title="3. Shooting Script"></a>3. Shooting Script</h3><p>The director usually uses this style of scripting. After the director of the film or the documentary, the screenplay reads the literary script. He writes a subordinate storyline, including the picture image and the sound, which he is agreed to represent in his film or documentary screenplay.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Six-basic-theoretical-knowledge-about-documentary-script"><a href="#Part-3-Six-basic-theoretical-knowledge-about-documentary-script" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Six basic theoretical knowledge about documentary script"></a>Part 3. Six basic theoretical knowledge about documentary script</h2><h3 id="1-Ensure-the-authenticity-of-the-story"><a href="#1-Ensure-the-authenticity-of-the-story" class="headerlink" title="1. Ensure the authenticity of the story"></a>1. Ensure the authenticity of the story</h3><p>The first and most important step in writing a documentary screenplay is to make sure the material and information you use is accurate. Moreover, if your documentary script is based on a true story, you should first confirm the veracity of the tale before drafting the script. It elevates the level of your script’s content quality.</p><h3 id="2-Define-the-key-issues"><a href="#2-Define-the-key-issues" class="headerlink" title="2. Define the key issues"></a>2. Define the key issues</h3><p>Another thing that makes a documentary script best is that it should define the critical issues of the topic upon which it relies. For example, writing a documentary script on a social problem, you should also define its key points. Also, you can add interviews of the experts, or the people involved in some story. It makes your documentary script more effective and influential for the audience.</p><h3 id="3-Highlight-the-characteristics-of-the-scene"><a href="#3-Highlight-the-characteristics-of-the-scene" class="headerlink" title="3. Highlight the characteristics of the scene"></a>3. Highlight the characteristics of the scene</h3><p>Highlighting the characteristics of each scene of your script makes it much better and easy for others to understand. For example, if you have any fighting scene in your documentary film, you should have to define each thing that will be there and film it in your screenplay. Also, you can suggest or specify the location of each scene.</p><h3 id="4-Visual-Writing"><a href="#4-Visual-Writing" class="headerlink" title="4. Visual Writing"></a>4. Visual Writing</h3><p>Visual Writing means you should make it clear in your script which will be there in a specific scene. Moreover, it would be best if you also described your character’s situation. It is the most necessary thing in a documentary script, so you should never take it side.</p><h3 id="5-Guaranteed-documentary-viewing-Rhythm"><a href="#5-Guaranteed-documentary-viewing-Rhythm" class="headerlink" title="5. Guaranteed documentary viewing (Rhythm)"></a>5. Guaranteed documentary viewing (Rhythm)</h3><p>Another important thing you should take care of while writing a documentary script is that you should continue it in a rhythm, which means you have to pay good attention to the sequence of the events in your film. In other words, you should arrange your script’s scenes effectively and accurately, making them in a rhythm.</p><h3 id="6-Fully-researched"><a href="#6-Fully-researched" class="headerlink" title="6. Fully researched"></a>6. Fully researched</h3><p>Thoroughly researched data and information are the most necessary, especially when writing a script for a documentary screenplay. It would be best first to explore a particular topic on which you will write a documentary script and then start writing one. It makes your script the best and helps you write it because you will gain excellent knowledge of it by researching a particular topic. Also, it dramatically improves the quality of your script’s content. So you should never leave this step before writing a documentary script.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Documentary-script-examples"><a href="#Part-4-Documentary-script-examples" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Additionally, several video-sharing platforms encourage artists to share and promote themselves in creative ways. However, how much will it cost to shoot a music video? Below is how you can determine the answer to that.</p><p><strong>Creating a Budget</strong></p><p>The budget for your music video usually covers pre-production, concept development, casting, storyboards, choreography, location fee, rehearsal, production equipment, on-camera talent, props, costumes, post-production, editing, and many more. For a professional video, you can budget anywhere from $20,000 to $500,000. Sometimes, it costs even more, depending on the concept you’re looking to achieve.</p><p>However, if you have a lower budget, you would have to forego the inclusion of high-end visual effects, expensive locations, and many more.

For example, if your editor would be using advanced visual effects, they could charge between 70-150 dollars for each hour. Colorists are also part of the post-production cost, and their fee usually depends on the final product quality you would like to achieve.</p><p><strong>Additional Costs</strong></p><p>Apart from production and post-production costs, there are several more costs you need to consider. These costs are essential because they help to make your video come together. One of the additional costs to consider is the cast and crew. A fantastic music video requires talented people.

Then you will be available with the video file on a timeline that you want to edit.</li><li>Now, drag the play head on the timeline where you want to start the zoom effect to take place.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/preview-timeline-videoleap.jpg"                      alt="preview timeline videoleap"                ></p><ul><li>Then select the “keyframes” tool from the toolbar at the bottom of your screen.</li><li>Add the keyframes to the desired portion of the video and then navigate the timecode to the place on the timeline where you want to stop it. After that add another keyframe at that point and pinch in to zoom the video.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-keyframes-videoleap.jpg"                      alt="add keyframes videoleap"                ></p><ul><li>Now head to the second time code where you want to focus the subject and then click on it. Then click on the “Preview” icon and see whether it needs further changes.</li><li>When you are satisfied, simply export the project and your animated zoom video will be saved successfully.</li></ul><h2 id="Alternative-way-to-Zoom-Video-on-Computer"><a href="#Alternative-way-to-Zoom-Video-on-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Alternative way to Zoom Video on Computer"></a>Alternative way to Zoom Video on Computer</h2><p>If for some reason you are not able to install and use Videoleap on your system or you want to switch to any other applications, then Filmora is the best available alternative. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a paid video editing application that can be used on a trial basis with limited options.
