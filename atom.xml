    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Unlocking-Full-Potential-In-Depth-Review-of-LG’s-Monitor-Tech"><a href="#Unlocking-Full-Potential-In-Depth-Review-of-LG’s-Monitor-Tech" class="headerlink" title="Unlocking Full Potential: In-Depth Review of LG’s Monitor Tech"></a>Unlocking Full Potential: In-Depth Review of LG’s Monitor Tech</h2><h1 id="LG-UltraFine-4K-Monitor-Complete-Review"><a href="#LG-UltraFine-4K-Monitor-Complete-Review" class="headerlink" title="LG UltraFine 4K Monitor Complete Review"></a>LG UltraFine 4K Monitor Complete Review</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Max-Wales"><a href="#Max-Wales" class="headerlink" title="Max Wales"></a>Max Wales</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> You will see very few successful partnerships in the market but there is something unique about LG and Apple. They together have designed incredible 4K displays that are budget friendly and feature rich too. LG UltraFine 4K monitor is just a fantastic choice for beginners as well as professionals. Here are few incredible details about this UltraFine 4K monitor that will help you to make easy decision about investment.</p><h2 id="Features-and-Performance"><a href="#Features-and-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Features and Performance"></a>Features and Performance</h2><h4 id="1-Design-Style"><a href="#1-Design-Style" class="headerlink" title="1.Design Style"></a>1.Design Style</h4><p> This monitor appears somewhat like UltraFine 5K but with smaller form factor. It has attractive round edges and you will not find bezels with its little face. It displays everything in non-distracting manner. The overall screen size is 21.5 inches and this monitor works like a multi-tasker unit. It is well known as professional grade video and photo editor that can be easily rotated to any possible direction as per need. UltraFine 4K has wide elevation range and its elevation mount is highly sturdy with telescopic design. You can easily handle this stand and it is possible to attach this monitor to standard VESA mount having special VESA cover. You will not find any button on its frame, not even the power button so it appears very clean. Everything can be handled with automatic tweak settings and it is also possible to manage most of the things via Mac OS also. Behind the screen, there are stereo speakers that ensure incredible performance.</p><h4 id="2-Ports-and-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Ports-and-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2.Ports and Connectivity"></a>2.Ports and Connectivity</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lg-ultrafine-4k-monitor-ports.jpg"                      alt="Lg-ultrafine-4k-monitor-ports"                ></p><p> You must be curious to know about the connectivity options available with this fine line monitor. There are two options: Thunderbolt 3 ports and USB type port. You can access its USB-C port to manage power, audio and data transfers even with single cable. That means you can charge your MacBook directly from this monitor. Note that, the USB-C port cannot work same as ThunderBolt 3 that allows users to enjoy much higher transfer speeds but this port stays restricted to MacBook Pro. You will not be able to find DisplayPort and HDMI connection options on this monitor but it just enhances design and saves more space.</p><p> Here, you will be transmitting data and videos on USB-C port instead of using ThunderBolt 3. This type of connectivity limits the expected capabilities of this monitor as one can enjoy lesser bandwidth where USB-C port follows speed range of USB 2.0 port.</p><h4 id="3-Image-Quality"><a href="#3-Image-Quality" class="headerlink" title="3.Image Quality"></a>3.Image Quality</h4><p> If we call this display same as that of Apple products then the indication is directly towards its quality. Right from the moment when you turn this monitor ON for the very first time, it appears brilliant, vibrant and bright with impressively managed colours on every portion of the screen. Those who are using the retina type displays of MacBooks from several years will find this screen perfect for their needs as they need not to compromise for low resolution. This UltraFine display monitor can handle P3 color gamut that leads to incredible results for videos as well as images. It means you will find this monitor perfectly suitable to access your mobile photography with deep details. This LG monitor has matte black look on borders and that give ultimate impression. The glossy screen makes stunning color popup but this screen is not much suitable for bright locations. This 21.5” monitor can handle 4,096x2,304 resolution level with crisp details. You can access the scaling feature of MacBook to improve its text size up to readable level.</p><h4 id="4-Multi-Function-Screen-Manager"><a href="#4-Multi-Function-Screen-Manager" class="headerlink" title="4.Multi Function Screen Manager"></a>4.Multi Function Screen Manager</h4><p> Here is one important thing to note about LG UltraFine 4K monitor; manufacturers have designed it to work perfectly with MacOS with multi function screen manager option. That means, users can easily divide their monitor screen into 2 to 4 frames so that multiple things can be accessed at a time without facing any complexity in handling. All the screens get well arranged on this monitor and the displays appear perfectly fine.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148646/16836" target="_top" id="2148646">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148646" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148646/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Compatible-with-Windows"><a href="#Compatible-with-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Compatible with Windows?"></a>Compatible with Windows?</h2><p> Now, this must be the most important question in every reader’s mind. Those who have PCs at their home must be thinking to find better connectivity options on windows. So the great news is that there is no technical issue related to such connection. But we have few reasons that limit your usage on windows.</p><p> You will find several monitors that are designed with classic colour profiles. Note that, if these monitors do not find a computer that can handle extended gamut then they keep on reflecting back the details to sRGB mechanism. This is a big trouble. But when you connect such high end monitors with MacOS then you will be able to handle everything via specially designed software AppKit. It helps to make perfect negotiation with the monitor color information and everything on screen appears good. Thus, it is better to use this monitor with MacOS only.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2112008/7443" target="_top" id="2112008">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2112008" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2112008/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> If you already own the 12” MacBook of Apple then this LG Ultrafine display unit is best choice for you. Some of you may find its 21.5” screen size little smaller but it suits perfectly to the Apple’s notebook collections. Professionals can easily handle all movements with touch bar on their device and its ability to handle multiple screens at a time makes it more suitable for high end users. The aesthetic performance of LG UltraFine 4K device is definitely awesome; you need not to make any compromise for video clarity, quality and performance on this device. The overall score as per reviewers rating is 4 out of 5 for this stunning 4K monitor. It is good to place your order fast to receive this well designed monitor soon at your door step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130532/26400" target="_top" id="2130532">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130532" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130532/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-vegas-pro-21-the-new-standard-for-sportsbook-simplicity-and-complexity-for-2024/"><u>[New] Vegas Pro '21 - The New Standard for Sportsbook Simplicity & Complexity for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-identifying-when-unfriended-on-snapchat-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Identifying When Unfriended on Snapchat for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-quickvid-simplified-w11-screen-capture-software-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] QuickVid Simplified W11 Screen Capture Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/approved-maximize-profitability-the-dos-and-donts-of-youtube-monetization/"><u>2024 Approved Maximize Profitability – The Do's and Don'ts of YouTube Monetization</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/dynamic-design-building-perspective-with-text/"><u>Dynamic Design Building Perspective with Text</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/facial-lockout-a-deep-dive-into-iphones-face-id-vs-galaxys-recognition/"><u>Facial Lockout A Deep Dive Into iPhone's Face ID Vs.

Create a Video to Save the Highlights of Snowboard Cross"></a>Part 2. Create a Video to Save the Highlights of Snowboard Cross</h2><p>When you check out high-quality snowboard cross highlights videos online, you will find that there are certain elements that are common across all such videos. Starting from video effects and video editing to audio additions, here are all the common features used in snowboard cross highlights.</p><p>Pan and Zoom - You will see that still photos are slowly zooming and finally focusing on the main athlete in a group competition. This effect is called pan and zoom effect and it is currently the trending feature in a highlight video with still footage.</p><p>Transition - Transition effects are the most commonly used effects in a highlight video where still photos are used continuously. The transition effects make shifting from one photo to another smooth and eye-pleasing. The video editor you choose to make your highlight video should have ample number of transition effects.</p><p>Slow Motion - You need to have slow motion effect on your snowboard cross finals. This is because you will have to allow your viewers to check out the video footages comfortably to understand the best moments. There is no doubt that video footages are the main selling point in a highlight video and therefore, you have to give enough time on the clips that you collect from social media platforms.</p><p>Motion Tracking - Motion tracking could be the x-factor in any sports event highlight video. Motion tracking is highlighting a particular athlete such as the winner throughout a video clip so that the viewers could understand who the winner is and how he performed. You can highlight the athlete through motion tracking by attaching arrow, text, clipart and likewise.</p><p>Texts and Voiceover - Most highlight videos show titles and texts over the still photos of the event so that the viewers can understand the highlights and moments easily. The titles and texts are shown with animation for better traction. However, there are many professional video creators who prefer voiceover instead of showing texts as voiceover gives a life to the video.</p><h3 id="A-Professional-Video-Editor"><a href="#A-Professional-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="A Professional Video Editor"></a>A Professional <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>You need to have all the above-mentioned video effects and audio options in the video editor that you choose to make your video highlights.

Create a Video to Save the Highlights of Snowboard Cross"></a>Part 2. Create a Video to Save the Highlights of Snowboard Cross</h2><p>When you check out high-quality snowboard cross highlights videos online, you will find that there are certain elements that are common across all such videos. Starting from video effects and video editing to audio additions, here are all the common features used in snowboard cross highlights.</p><p>Pan and Zoom - You will see that still photos are slowly zooming and finally focusing on the main athlete in a group competition. This effect is called pan and zoom effect and it is currently the trending feature in a highlight video with still footage.</p><p>Transition - Transition effects are the most commonly used effects in a highlight video where still photos are used continuously. The transition effects make shifting from one photo to another smooth and eye-pleasing. The video editor you choose to make your highlight video should have ample number of transition effects.</p><p>Slow Motion - You need to have slow motion effect on your snowboard cross finals. This is because you will have to allow your viewers to check out the video footages comfortably to understand the best moments. There is no doubt that video footages are the main selling point in a highlight video and therefore, you have to give enough time on the clips that you collect from social media platforms.</p><p>Motion Tracking - Motion tracking could be the x-factor in any sports event highlight video. Motion tracking is highlighting a particular athlete such as the winner throughout a video clip so that the viewers could understand who the winner is and how he performed. You can highlight the athlete through motion tracking by attaching arrow, text, clipart and likewise.</p><p>Texts and Voiceover - Most highlight videos show titles and texts over the still photos of the event so that the viewers can understand the highlights and moments easily. The titles and texts are shown with animation for better traction. However, there are many professional video creators who prefer voiceover instead of showing texts as voiceover gives a life to the video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918703/19272" target="_top" id="1918703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918703/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="A-Professional-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#A-Professional-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="A Professional Video Editor"></a>A Professional <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>You need to have all the above-mentioned video effects and audio options in the video editor that you choose to make your video highlights.

Here is the list of the top 10 best text effects that you should know.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Underwater Text Effect</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Flame Text Effect</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Glitch Text Effect</a></li><li><a href="#part1-4">3D Text Effect</a></li><li><a href="#part1-5">Comic Book Text Effect</a></li><li><a href="#part1-6">Blurry Fade on Text Effect</a></li><li><a href="#part1-7">Type on Text Effect</a></li><li><a href="#part1-8">Animate Along a Path</a></li><li><a href="#part1-9">Slide Text Effect</a></li><li><a href="#part1-10">Stripe Text Effect</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">How to Create Text Effects</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Popular-Text-Effects"><a href="#Part-1-Popular-Text-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Popular Text Effects"></a>Part 1. Popular Text Effects</h2><p>There are certain text effects that you generally come across whether you are watching movies, web series, and videos on social media or video streaming platforms. We have compiled a list of the most popular text effects that are extremely relevant in the current times in videography.</p><h3 id="1-Underwater-Text-Effect"><a href="#1-Underwater-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="1. Underwater Text Effect"></a>1. Underwater Text Effect</h3><p>Opening a video with the view of a beach and blue water is definitely stunning. But when you add an underwater text effect to display any title, it instantly grabs the attention of the viewers. In the underwater text effect, your text seems to be fixated or floating under the water. The text generally has a darker shade of blue over the light bluish water.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/under-water-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="under water text effect"                ></p><p>The text also has some distortion effect due to the waves in the water body so that it looks more realistic. There are different variations of that underwater text effect such as the text emerging out of water when there is a side view of the water body is taken. Another example of the variation is that text is floating over the water and having a watery gel or bubbly texture.</p><h3 id="2-Flame-Text-Effect"><a href="#2-Flame-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="2. Flame Text Effect"></a>2. Flame Text Effect</h3><p>Flame text effect is extremely common in the opening and closing credits of a video especially when it is an action video. Generally, a dark background is set against the fiery text so that the flame effect is more prominent and eye-catching. In fact, some video creators prefer a fiery background out of which the text with flame text effect emerges and make the required impact.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/flame-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="flame text effect"                ></p><p>There are different variations of the flame text effect available which make the effect relevant even today. Instead of the flame text effect spread outside of the text, the effect is contained within the text when the text is large enough to accommodate flames prominently within it. Sometimes, the text is distorted as if the fire is burning the text.</p><h3 id="3-Glitch-Text-Effect"><a href="#3-Glitch-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="3. Glitch Text Effect"></a>3. Glitch Text Effect</h3><p>Glitch text effect is an extremely popular effect in modern times where retro video effects are reaching a new high. The glitch text effect is designed to get the attention of the viewers instantly. In the glitch text effect, the text is divided into different sections and they are distorted or dispersed slightly as if your screen has a display issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/glitch-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="glitch text effect"                ></p><p>Glitch text effect is more prominent when it is applied to a large text having a light color against a dark background. The use of shadow and blur effect to get the desired glitch effect is common. More often than not, some short straight lines like strokes are placed around the text to enhance the glitch effect. Some creators prefer glitch text effect on 3D texts for a better visual appeal.</p><h3 id="4-3D-Text-Effect"><a href="#4-3D-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="4. 3D Text Effect"></a>4. 3D Text Effect</h3><p>3D text effect has been popular ever since its inception and its popularity has been steady in the videography world even today. Of course, with time, the effect has changed a lot to match the different niches of videos, and hence, you will come across a wide variety of 3D text effects. Starting from full screen texts and titles to adverts and promotional texts, 3D text effects find a place everywhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3d-text-video-effect.jpg"                      alt="3d text video effect"                ></p><p>Starting from 3D texts coming out of the background wall to 3D hologram text effect with retro look, you can apply any 3D effect to the texts and titles of your video as per relevancy. Most importantly, there is a wide scope for customization and personalization to captivate the viewers and get the message across clearly. You can go through 3D text After Effects tutorial and embed 3D texts in your video easily.</p><h3 id="5-Comic-Book-Text-Effect"><a href="#5-Comic-Book-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="5. Comic Book Text Effect"></a>5. Comic Book Text Effect</h3><p>Comic book text effect is an old-school style but its application in funny segments of a video is quite popular. Comic book typography has a superhero feel and it is mostly used while making the transition from one segment of a video to another. You will find several interview videos where the comic book text effect is used to show titles of different segments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/comic-book-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="comic book text effect"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997722/19272" target="_top" id="1997722">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997722" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997722/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Similarly, it is used for displaying texts and titles in anime videos. The text effect has a cartoonish look and a comic background to enhance the text effect. There could also be a blasting effect in the background that can act as a highlighter. The text color in the comic text effect also has a retro feel but bright in outlook.</p><h3 id="6-Blurry-Fade-on-Text-Effect"><a href="#6-Blurry-Fade-on-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="6. Blurry Fade on Text Effect"></a>6. Blurry Fade on Text Effect</h3><p>Blurry fade on is such a pleasing effect for the human eye especially when it is in animated form. The blurry fade on effect is like looking at a word with your specs on while the words in its surrounding come with blur effect. This text effect is widely used when there is a need to highlight certain words in a sentence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/blurry-fade-on-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="blurry fade on text effect"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137212/26400" target="_top" id="2137212">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137212" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137212/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>In fact, the text effect is used to highlight a few characters in a word while the others remain blurred. You can also use the effect when you are making transitions between different texts and titles. It is more like an add-on to the usual fade on effect as it adds a blurring effect. It is important to get the attention of the viewers to specific texts.</p><h3 id="7-Type-on-Text-Effect"><a href="#7-Type-on-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="7. Type on Text Effect"></a>7. Type on Text Effect</h3><p>The type on text effect is also referred to as the typewriter effect.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="SDR-Upgrade-Manual-Unveiling-the-Secrets-of-HDR-Transformation"><a href="#SDR-Upgrade-Manual-Unveiling-the-Secrets-of-HDR-Transformation" class="headerlink" title="SDR Upgrade Manual: Unveiling the Secrets of HDR Transformation"></a>SDR Upgrade Manual: Unveiling the Secrets of HDR Transformation</h2><p><em>“I shot HDR video clips with the camera for my YouTube videos, but part of the footage is SDR, I hope to get a consistent video presentation, how could I do?”</em></p><p><em>So what do you do with all of your existing SDR content? To solve this, SDR to HDR conversion or vice versa can be one of the best solutions. So let’s take a further look at the available options to create amazing upconversions.</em></p><h2 id="Can-I-convert-the-SDR-video-to-HDR"><a href="#Can-I-convert-the-SDR-video-to-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Can I convert the SDR video to HDR?"></a>Can I convert the SDR video to HDR?</h2><p>Before diving into concrete steps, it’s best to have a decent understanding of how it works. Changing from SDR to HDR is possible, but with specific sequences, the results can vary accordingly. Of course, the video’s original quality would influence how it looks in the final outcome, even if you convert it into the high dynamic range or HDR version.</p><p>The camera noise and compression artifacts that are available in the video file will become more enhanced after the upconverting process. This means more clean-up work during and after the processing will become necessary. So, <strong>converting SDR to HDR</strong> successfully from the source file will not change entirely in some methods.</p><p>Given all that, does it even need to convert SDF video into HDR, you may ask. The answer is yes. Here are some reasons why:</p><ul><li><strong>Dark&#x2F;Light Balance</strong></li></ul><p>HDR content assures more light-and-dark balance in the videos&#x2F;images captured compared to the displayed version. The HDR video files have more defined highlights and shadows and noticeable luminance differences in scenes. So, the imagery is more realistic whether one clicks pictures outdoors or indoors, during the day or night.</p><ul><li><strong>3D Effect</strong></li></ul><p>Videos with a high dynamic range have enhanced depth perception. So, the surface objects are more noticeable, with perceptible shadows under the object against the background. Therefore, the files have a three-dimensional effect after you turn <strong>SDR to HDR.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>A wide color gamut is available</strong></li></ul><p>HDR video comes with the availability of a wider color gamut that is not supported under SDR. With HDR, it is possible to expand the luminance and contrast levels, and color gradients are more prominent. To note, SDR monitors run with the Rec.709 colorspace spectrum, while HDR supports a wider Rec.2020 colorspace with more color variations.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Up-mapping-SDR-Archive-Content-to-HDR"><a href="#Method-1-Up-mapping-SDR-Archive-Content-to-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Up-mapping SDR Archive Content to HDR"></a>Method 1: Up-mapping SDR Archive Content to HDR</h3><p>It is possible to <strong>convert SDR to HDR</strong> after the legacy video-based content is mastered or recorded in SDR quality. Here, one can upconvert the content quality to HDR using the inverse tone mapping procedure. There are three content types that fall under the SDR Archive Content version:</p><ul><li><strong>SDR live-captured video content that comes with uncontrolled lighting</strong>. An example here includes Live Outdoor Sports shooting.</li><li><strong>SDR live-captured video content is available with controlled lighting</strong>. Examples include concerts, studio content recordings, and Indoor Sports shooting.</li><li><strong>Post-produced or mastered SDR content</strong>. These examples are documentaries and movies.</li></ul><p>Two sequences are available for upconverting SDR content from the archive to HDR. A suitable method would be to use the inverse tone-mapping functionality to set the HDR effect on the SDR content.</p><p>This process makes the SDR clips blend smoothly into the HDR content after you remaster them. You can use the real-time inverse tone-mapping tools and converters to make the SDR to HDR conversion.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Up-convert-SDR-clips-to-HDR-with-Video-editing-Software"><a href="#Method-2-Up-convert-SDR-clips-to-HDR-with-Video-editing-Software" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Up-convert SDR clips to HDR with Video-editing Software"></a>Method 2: Up-convert SDR clips to HDR with Video-editing Software</h3><p>One of the best ways to convert SDR to HDR is to use video editing software. Not every editor supports SDR to HDR conversion, but <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> does, especially with new upgrades since the v.11.5.4 version. Upgrades are visible under BorisFX effects, like the improved split mode function, Denoise effects, etc.</p><p>Additionally, it supports almost all kinds of formats, like MP4, M4V, MPG, VOB, HDR, and WMV.

Although it offers some useful features, the free edition includes way too many advertisements. <strong>ToonApp Pro</strong> is an option if you’d like a better experience. But in the end, it’s the finest option for having fun with photo editing.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Advantages</strong></th><th><strong>Disadvantages</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Convert any picture into a cartoon easily</td><td>Too many ads</td></tr><tr><td>A free version is available</td><td>Subscribe notice after every click</td></tr><tr><td>Easy to Use</td><td>A short trial of the premium version</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-ToonApp"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-ToonApp" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

You can edit and add filters, cartoons, and backgrounds to the pictures.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> By clicking the link below, you can download the app from the app store. The two most widely used mobile operating systems are supported: <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lyrebirdstudio.cartoon&hl=en_US&gl=US" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> | <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toonapp-cartoon-photo-editor/id1540719743" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Price:</strong> You can use the ToonApp for free, but it shows many ads in the freemium version and also have a watermark on every edit. However, you can eliminate these ads and the watermark by subscribing to their weekly or yearly plan. A three to seven-day trial of the premium edition is also available, but you must first proceed by entering payment information. If you decide against it, you can cancel it before the trial period is through and won’t be charged. Also, no plugins are available, but the full-body cartoon effect is not free. It is only available for trial or subscription.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Key-features-of-ToonApp"><a href="#Part-2-Key-features-of-ToonApp" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Key features of ToonApp"></a>Part 2. Key features of ToonApp</h2><p>Now let’s look into some key features of the ToonApp:</p><h3 id="1-Remarkable-Toon-Filter"><a href="#1-Remarkable-Toon-Filter" class="headerlink" title="1. Remarkable Toon Filter"></a>1. Remarkable Toon Filter</h3><p>Nowadays, cartoon or anime-like pictures are trending in styles and filters. Many well-known people have used effects like these on their social media accounts, which is a significant cause of the popularity of these effects. ToonApp provides many AI features that can restore your look as a cartoon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/toonapp-review-1.jpg"                      alt="remarkable toon filter"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137975/21526" target="_top" id="2137975">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137975" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137975/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Full-Body-Cartoon"><a href="#2-Full-Body-Cartoon" class="headerlink" title="2. Full Body Cartoon"></a>2. Full Body Cartoon</h3><p>The majority of cartoon filter apps you can find in app stores either work on your face or a select number just work on your body, with the background either being erased or left alone. However, ToonApp features an AI tool that can assist you if you also want to change your original background into a cartoon while keeping it. Then you might benefit from this effect. However, ToonApp Pro is the only app that offers this capability.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/toonapp-review-2.jpg"                      alt="full body cartoon"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151893/7443" target="_top" id="2151893">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151893" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151893/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-3D-Cartoon"><a href="#3-3D-Cartoon" class="headerlink" title="3. 3D Cartoon"></a>3. 3D Cartoon</h3><p>This is another excellent feature that ToonApp is offering and is available in a free version. Using this feature, your face will become a 3D cartoon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/toonapp-review-3.jpg"                      alt="3d cartoon"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-use-ToonApp"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-use-ToonApp" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to use ToonApp?"></a>Part 3. How to use ToonApp?</h2><p>It’s time to discuss some steps of using the ToonApp:</p><h5 id="Step1-Select-Effect-and-Photo-to-Edit"><a href="#Step1-Select-Effect-and-Photo-to-Edit" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Select Effect and Photo to Edit"></a>Step1 Select Effect and Photo to Edit</h5><p>Once you’ve entered the app, six effects will show up. The very first step is to choose any effect that you want. Then you have to choose a picture or capture one at the moment. Remember that your image is clear; otherwise, the AI can’t recognize and edit it. The drawback while importing is that, by default, the app doesn’t show all your gallery images; instead, the AI finds the most suitable photos according to the selected effect and shows them randomly. However, you can choose the gallery option to select from your gallery. Also, you are only able to select one image at a time. After selecting a photo, you can continue by clicking the create cartoon button.</p><h5 id="Step2-Choose-the-Background"><a href="#Step2-Choose-the-Background" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Choose the Background"></a>Step2 Choose the Background</h5><p>After you’ve created your cartoon picture, the Toon App offers you to add some beautiful backgrounds to it. Select any background to add it. This feature is provided primarily in some effects where the AI removes your original background.</p><h5 id="Step3-Export-to-Gallery-and-Share"><a href="#Step3-Export-to-Gallery-and-Share" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Export to Gallery and Share"></a>Step3 Export to Gallery and Share</h5><p>Now that we’ve successfully edited the picture, you can tap the save button in the next step to export this photo to the gallery. In addition to this, you can also directly post it to different social media platforms using ToonApp sharing options. The overall quality of the picture is good, but to get even better quality, the premium version is required.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/toonapp-review-4.jpg"                      alt="export to gallery and share"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-ToonApp"><a href="#Part-4-Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-ToonApp" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Advantages and Disadvantages of ToonApp"></a>Part 4. Advantages and Disadvantages of ToonApp</h2><p>Here we will discuss some advantages and disadvantages of using ToonApp:</p><h3 id="Advantages"><a href="#Advantages" class="headerlink" title="Advantages"></a>Advantages</h3><h4 id="1-Free-Version"><a href="#1-Free-Version" class="headerlink" title="1. Free Version"></a><strong>1. Free Version</strong></h4><p>ToonApp is not like other apps that only have premium versions and trials. If you don’t want to switch on ToonApp Pro, you can still use its free version with ads and other limitations like the watermark is not removable and some premium effects are not unlocked. But still, it has a lot to entertain you.</p><h4 id="2-Easy-To-Use"><a href="#2-Easy-To-Use" class="headerlink" title="2. Easy To Use"></a><strong>2. Easy To Use</strong></h4><p>You just have to provide your photo and let the AI effects do all tasks. Moreover, it’s too easy to navigate because ToonApp has a simple interface with quick exporting and sharing.</p><h3 id="Disadvantages"><a href="#Disadvantages" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages"></a>Disadvantages</h3><h4 id="1-Too-many-advertisements"><a href="#1-Too-many-advertisements" class="headerlink" title="1. Too many advertisements"></a><strong>1. Too many advertisements</strong></h4><p>One of its significant drawbacks is that ads appear in free versions after every step. These ads also consist of premium subscription notices. They sometimes highly distract the user experience.</p><h4 id="2-Watermark-and-HD-Export"><a href="#2-Watermark-and-HD-Export" class="headerlink" title="2. Watermark and HD Export"></a><strong>2. Watermark and HD Export</strong></h4><p>Another main disadvantage is that users using ToonApp free will have no option to remove the watermark or save their picture in High Quality.</p><h2 id="Part-5-What-is-the-online-ToonApp"><a href="#Part-5-What-is-the-online-ToonApp" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. What is the online ToonApp"></a>Part 5. What is the online ToonApp</h2><p>Sometimes we don’t want to download an app and look for some online alternative. So, here is the ToonApp online alternative, <a class="link"   href="https://toonme.com/" >ToonMe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>You can use ToonMe by uploading your simple picture, and ToonMe will then return you cartoon pictures with various style options from which you can choose the best one.

ToonApp provides many AI features that can restore your look as a cartoon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/toonapp-review-1.jpg"                      alt="remarkable toon filter"                ></p><h3 id="2-Full-Body-Cartoon-1"><a href="#2-Full-Body-Cartoon-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Full Body Cartoon"></a>2. Full Body Cartoon</h3><p>The majority of cartoon filter apps you can find in app stores either work on your face or a select number just work on your body, with the background either being erased or left alone. However, ToonApp features an AI tool that can assist you if you also want to change your original background into a cartoon while keeping it. Then you might benefit from this effect. However, ToonApp Pro is the only app that offers this capability.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/toonapp-review-2.jpg"                      alt="full body cartoon"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137205/26400" target="_top" id="2137205">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137205" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137205/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1834906">                    <video width="864" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834906.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1834906">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834906.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2F25home.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1834906%2F16836'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1834906/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-3D-Cartoon-1"><a href="#3-3D-Cartoon-1" class="headerlink" title="3. 3D Cartoon"></a>3. 3D Cartoon</h3><p>This is another excellent feature that ToonApp is offering and is available in a free version.

How to use ToonApp?"></a>Part 3. How to use ToonApp?</h2><p>It’s time to discuss some steps of using the ToonApp:</p><h5 id="Step1-Select-Effect-and-Photo-to-Edit-1"><a href="#Step1-Select-Effect-and-Photo-to-Edit-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Select Effect and Photo to Edit"></a>Step1 Select Effect and Photo to Edit</h5><p>Once you’ve entered the app, six effects will show up. The very first step is to choose any effect that you want. Then you have to choose a picture or capture one at the moment. Remember that your image is clear; otherwise, the AI can’t recognize and edit it. The drawback while importing is that, by default, the app doesn’t show all your gallery images; instead, the AI finds the most suitable photos according to the selected effect and shows them randomly. However, you can choose the gallery option to select from your gallery. Also, you are only able to select one image at a time. After selecting a photo, you can continue by clicking the create cartoon button.</p><h5 id="Step2-Choose-the-Background-1"><a href="#Step2-Choose-the-Background-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Choose the Background"></a>Step2 Choose the Background</h5><p>After you’ve created your cartoon picture, the Toon App offers you to add some beautiful backgrounds to it. Select any background to add it. This feature is provided primarily in some effects where the AI removes your original background.</p><h5 id="Step3-Export-to-Gallery-and-Share-1"><a href="#Step3-Export-to-Gallery-and-Share-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Export to Gallery and Share"></a>Step3 Export to Gallery and Share</h5><p>Now that we’ve successfully edited the picture, you can tap the save button in the next step to export this photo to the gallery. In addition to this, you can also directly post it to different social media platforms using ToonApp sharing options. The overall quality of the picture is good, but to get even better quality, the premium version is required.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/toonapp-review-4.jpg"                      alt="export to gallery and share"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-ToonApp-1"><a href="#Part-4-Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-ToonApp-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

If you don’t want to switch on ToonApp Pro, you can still use its free version with ads and other limitations like the watermark is not removable and some premium effects are not unlocked. But still, it has a lot to entertain you.</p><h4 id="2-Easy-To-Use-1"><a href="#2-Easy-To-Use-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Easy To Use"></a><strong>2. Easy To Use</strong></h4><p>You just have to provide your photo and let the AI effects do all tasks. Moreover, it’s too easy to navigate because ToonApp has a simple interface with quick exporting and sharing.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134244/18498" target="_top" id="2134244">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134244" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134244/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Disadvantages-1"><a href="#Disadvantages-1" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages"></a>Disadvantages</h3><h4 id="1-Too-many-advertisements-1"><a href="#1-Too-many-advertisements-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

However, do you realize that you can use speech-to-text technology in PowerPoint? Yes! It is effortless and fun-filled: dictate, and create presentable slides with your speech. What is more fun than speaking and seeing your speech in electronic formats? This article teaches how you can create presentations via speech-to-text technology and how you can use real-time translation in PowerPoint.</p><p><strong>Best Speech-To-Text Software</strong> Save plenty of time on transcribing subtitles and boost your editing efficiency by applying Filmora Speech-To-Text to make perfect PPT videos.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make PPT Videos Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make PPT Videos Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Explore STT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-enable-speech-to-text-in-PowerPoint"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-enable-speech-to-text-in-PowerPoint" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to enable speech-to-text in PowerPoint?"></a>Part 1: How to enable speech-to-text in PowerPoint?</h2><p>Using speech-to-text in PowerPoint is the same principle guiding other platforms like Microsoft Words. Also, PowerPoint presentation on a windows device is similar to a Mac. However, some control and key functions differ in the two devices. The only thing you should note when you want to use the speech-to-text function is the type of device you are using. You can enable “speech-to-text” on devices like Mac, Windows, and mobile phones.</p><p>Please note that “enabling speech-to-text” in PowerPoint differs from “using speech-to-text.” For example, you have to enable the speech-to-text first before you can use it. Also, how you enable speech-to-text in PowerPoint is based on the selected devices. Let’s discuss enabling speech-to-text on Mac and Windows.</p><h3 id="Enable-speech-to-text-on-Mac"><a href="#Enable-speech-to-text-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Enable speech-to-text on Mac"></a><strong>Enable speech-to-text on Mac</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Select the control button:</strong> Mac allows you to select the control button for activating speech-to-text the first time you want to use the feature. Unlike other devices, the control option pops up when you select the speech-to-text option.

Aside from the multi-language selection, you can explore the “slide show” settings for better understanding. You may see other options that best illustrate your need for translation in real-time on PowerPoint.</p><p>When you activate the real-time translation on PowerPoint, the settings occur in two stages: slideshow view and presenter view. You can vary the changes based on your view (as the presenter) or what people see (slideshow view).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134234/18498" target="_top" id="2134234">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134234" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134234/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-make-speech-to-text-and-translation-to-create-PowerPoint-videos"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-make-speech-to-text-and-translation-to-create-PowerPoint-videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to make speech-to-text and translation to create PowerPoint videos"></a>Part 4: How to make speech-to-text and translation to create PowerPoint videos</h2><p>When you want to make perfect PPT videos, you can use Filmora’s STT feature.

But later the modified models of GoPro influenced the market to the max.

Action camera lovers are curious to know such details in deep so that they can make better selection.</p><p> Garmin has ability to record data such as movement, speed and even readers from other devices like fitness tracker; thus it is an ideal device for athletes who wish to track their workouts.

It possesses the miniUSB interface on the boxy shape and the attractive design make is look same as most of mobile devices.</p><h4 id="Fully-Waterproofed"><a href="#Fully-Waterproofed" class="headerlink" title="Fully Waterproofed:"></a><strong>Fully Waterproofed:</strong></h4><p> Here is a big advantage of buying Hero5 Black for adventure sports lovers because this camera can be taken under water up to 60 meter depth with a case. Garmin developers have still added beauty to their camera design even while supporting its waterproofing ability via additional case. It is possible to use the touch screen of this device with this additional casing up to 40 meters. Additionally the water proof case also assists in better mic connectivity so that sound can always stay as clear as it can be without case.</p><h4 id="GPS-Sensors"><a href="#GPS-Sensors" class="headerlink" title="GPS &amp; Sensors:"></a><strong>GPS &amp; Sensors:</strong></h4><p> Garmin design is offering G-Metrix that is an advanced fitness tracking overlay. It consists of so many advanced sensors like gyroscope, barometer, altimeter, accelerometer and magnetometer along with GPS sensor. It can record all major parameters during your workout including the measurement of pace, speed, altitude etc. This advanced unit can also capture data from other sensors like bike speed sensor, heart rate monitor and many more. The Edit software of Garmin assists users to incorporate this data automatically into videos.</p><p> But the GPS feature of GoPro Hero5 Black is not that useful as it works same as you common Instagram and Facebook applications. It simply adds tags to your footage and images saying you visited this place. This basic sensor cannot be used to track other details like Garmin sensors.</p><h4 id="Accessories-in-the-Box"><a href="#Accessories-in-the-Box" class="headerlink" title="Accessories in the Box:"></a><strong>Accessories in the Box:</strong></h4><p> When you will open up the Garmin Virb Ultra 30 box then following things will come out:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/garmin-accessories.jpg"                      alt="garmin-accessories"                ></p><ul><li>Garmin Virb Sticker</li><li>Anti Fog Kit</li><li>Wrench</li><li>Long and Short extension arms</li><li>Long and Short screws</li><li>Vertical mount and standard adapter</li><li>Curved and Flat adhesive mounts</li><li>Charging&#x2F;data cable</li><li>Lithium Ion Battery</li><li>Waterproof Case</li><li>Virb Ultra 30 Action Cam</li></ul><p> On the other side, GoPro Hero5 Black comes with following accessories:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gopro-hero5-black-accessories.jpg"                      alt="gopro-hero5-black-accessories"                ></p><ul><li>USB C Cable</li><li>Mounting Buckle</li><li>Flat and Curved Adhesive Mounts</li><li>Rechargeable Battery</li><li>Frame for Hero5 Black</li><li>Hero5 Black Camera</li></ul><h4 id="Usability-and-Control"><a href="#Usability-and-Control" class="headerlink" title="Usability and Control:"></a><strong>Usability and Control:</strong></h4><p> The 2” LCD touch screen of GoPro device makes navigation much easier and simple controls. You can directly make changes for field of view, frame rate and resolution from bottom layer. When you swipe left then it will call all recorded videos and photos whereas swiping right leads to advanced settings where you can control Raw file formats, white balance, ISO and many more. If we talk about Gramin VIRB Ultra 30 then its screen also offers so many shortcut controls. Left side leads to automatic video and photo setting key. Users find this interface much clearer as compared to GoPro device and the touch screen can be also operated with external housing. Gramin Ultra 30 can be directly connected to mobile application that also assists in live streaming of all recorded videos and photos.</p><h4 id="Video-and-Image-Quality"><a href="#Video-and-Image-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Video and Image Quality:"></a><strong>Video and Image Quality:</strong></h4><p> Hero5 Black can provide stunning video quality even at its HD 1080p resolution level and further much improved with 4K level. It never let footage details go blur but in case of Ultra 30 you can often find little blurred details. The footage colour support also differs by great extend in both cases as GoPro leads to a warn tone whereas Gramin is popular for its cool bias.</p><p> Hero5 Black allows users to create RAW images that can be later processed via additional software programs. Its wide dynamic mode assists in HDR level recording so that all shadows and highlights can be well captured. The addition of 4K resolution in Gramin is a big advantage for users as it leads to much crisp and breathtaking detail for every shoot. As the mics can be easily connected even with external housing so sound quality of this device is much better as compared to its competitor.</p><p> You can check the video from 3:45’’ to get detailed differences.</p><p> Whereas, the Ultra 30 has a better performance in low light.</p><h4 id="Electronic-Image-Stabilization"><a href="#Electronic-Image-Stabilization" class="headerlink" title="Electronic Image Stabilization:"></a><strong>Electronic Image Stabilization:</strong></h4><p> Both these devices are designed with electronic image stabilization and it is achieved with the help of software instead of hardware adjustments. Although both device manufacturers have worked upon this feature, yet Hero5 Black is reported to have better performance. Users reveal that Hero5 Black can provide impressive footage stabilization even when it is recorded by mounting camera over helmet while driving bike. This feature makes Hero5 Black camera footage safe from sudden shakes and jerks and is rated better for athletes. You can check the below video to get the detailed information.</p><h4 id="Advanced-Audio-Tracks"><a href="#Advanced-Audio-Tracks" class="headerlink" title="Advanced Audio Tracks:"></a><strong>Advanced Audio Tracks:</strong></h4><p> GoPro is developed with the advanced audio track support that allows users to record audio details in a secondary file and users can even generate three separate tracks with ease. This is actually a cool addition to GoPro series and an auto switch is always ready to reduce noise from recorded audio signals.</p><h4 id="Voice-Control"><a href="#Voice-Control" class="headerlink" title="Voice Control:"></a><strong>Voice Control:</strong></h4><p> Both Hero5 Black and Ultra 30 can be controlled with voice commands but the GoPro unit has more commands and allows better controls. The best part is that GoPro voice control supports seven different languages like: Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, German, Italian, French and English. All these commands can be send via a microphone same as the normal audio signals. For Garmin device this is just an introductory feature, it is not well developed but for beginners it is really good.</p><h4 id="App"><a href="#App" class="headerlink" title="App:"></a><strong>App:</strong></h4><p> GoPro action camera can be better controlled from iOS and Android devices with the help of specially designed GoPro apps. There are five different applications available for GoPro device: Capture, Quick (mobile &amp; desktop), Splice and GoPro Studio. On the other side Gramin Virb can also be controlled from distance via Virb Applications that also allow easy editing of footage. With Virb apps you can also enjoy live streaming on YouTube. Virb application can also be used on Mobile as well as on desktop.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657399/16446" target="_top" id="1657399">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657399" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657399/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> If you want to develop a unique and beautiful footage, then GoPro is best option for you, It can also lead to much stabilized details even when you record shoots from Karma drone and the Quick editor app can help you to improve details further. If we talk about Garmin then it deals with data in much better manner. The advanced monitoring sensors and activity trackers make it more useful for athletes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144309/7443" target="_top" id="2144309">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144309" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144309/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-kinemaster-tutorials-for-amazing-memes/"><u>[New] In 2024, KineMaster Tutorials for Amazing Memes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-achieving-professional-quality-remotely/"><u>[Updated] Achieving Professional Quality Remotely</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-change-location-on-facebook-marketplace-for-samsung-galaxy-f14-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways to Change Location on Facebook Marketplace for Samsung Galaxy F14 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-desktop-image-fusion/"><u>A Step-by-Step Guide to Desktop Image Fusion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/artificinas-and-labor-the-converging-pathways/"><u>Artificinas and Labor: The Converging Pathways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/crafting-a-superior-fpv-drone-setup-choosing-right-propellers/"><u>Crafting a Superior FPV Drone Setup Choosing Right Propellers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/how-to-repair-your-iphones-malfunctioning-voicemail-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>How to Repair Your iPhone's Malfunctioning Voicemail – A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/leading-software-titles-for-animation-artistry/"><u>Leading Software Titles for Animation Artistry</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/mastering-iphone-photo-angles-flip-and-tilt-with-skill/"><u>Mastering iPhone Photo Angles Flip & Tilt with Skill</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/navigating-through-a-galaxy-of-stars-how-to-watch-all-star-wars-movies-in-order-on-disney-plus/"><u>Navigating Through a Galaxy of Stars: How to Watch All Star Wars Movies in Order on Disney Plus</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/solitary-voice-collective-applause-a-podcast-journey/"><u>Solitary Voice, Collective Applause A Podcast Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/top-8-collaborative-video-collage-apps-for-android-users-freepaid/"><u>Top 8 Collaborative Video Collage Apps for Android Users (Free/Paid)</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

This model is designed to be a high-caliber Pro selection and a regular use work monitor that has all of the specs necessary for a variety of digital work tasks. If you are looking for a top quality 32-inch monitor for the use of everyday working tasks the UHD 4k monitor is near the top of many pro designers lists.</p><p><strong>Pros and Cons</strong></p><p> Overall this is a monitor that brings extensive value due to its LCD construction includes professional calibration software, and improved build quality, excellent styling for matching almost any office as well as an improved bright IPS panel, image quality, and Ultra HD resolutions.</p><p> The biggest problems that face this monitor are definitely the OSD calibration which is extremely inflexible; what’s more, the software which does not support the use of high-end instruments or even PC sharing with one keyboard and mouse. Other top-quality professional monitors do include the use of these features but they are also considerably more expensive.</p><h2 id="Asus-PA-329Q-Design-Quality"><a href="#Asus-PA-329Q-Design-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Asus PA 329Q Design Quality"></a>Asus PA 329Q Design Quality</h2><h4 id="1-Design-Style"><a href="#1-Design-Style" class="headerlink" title="1.Design Style"></a>1.Design Style</h4><p> The overall design of this device includes a 360° rotation for portrait mode, a sturdy and unique stand as well as a height adjustable operation. This is the type of monitor that you can use for ergonomic support day in and day out. The overall design style is made from modern office and it can be made to fit in almost any environment. Including eight ergonomic swivel, pivot, height adjustment and more is an ideal choice for many professionals who are looking for a monitor that they can use for preventing neck strain and improving long working hours each day.</p><p> The look of this monitor also comes with a beautiful logo that improves the branding of the monitor as well as strong materials all finished in matte black. This matte black construction really helps to improve the look of the monitor overall and to make sure that it can fade into almost any office setting. The cabinet finish features a 10 mm bezel which is not too distracting and ensures that if multiple monitors needed to be used for one workstation this could be done quite easily. Overall the monitor size is great and with the design of the adjustments it’s really easy to enjoy a functional design that goes far beyond the average 32 inch television or large display. The comfort adjustments on this make it perfect for professionals.</p><p> The stand and base are manufactured and extremely minimalist design which is functional yet extremely strong and study. This ensures that the entire unit can stand up quite well in a large office or across many cubicles and hours of work. The PA329Q is known for being adjustable in every way that an ASUS is providing for all of its 4 k monitors. If you have used one of these monitors in the past they can be extremely comfortable over long uses making them ideal for a workplace setting.</p><h4 id="2-Ports-and-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Ports-and-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2. Ports and Connectivity"></a>2. Ports and Connectivity</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-proart-pa329q-ports.jpg"                      alt="asus-proart-pa329q-ports"                ></p><p> The PA 329Q has almost any type of port that you might require in a workplace including four HDMI version 2.0 ports, mini display port 1.2 a standard display port 1.2 as well as five USB 3.0 ports, a nine in one card reader as well as an earphone jack.</p><p> Most of these ports are located directly underneath the monitor, and the only problem with this is that it can often lead to troubles with cord management. While most of the ports can be easily viewed by tilting the monitor, sometimes it can be difficult to plug items in for connectivity without first raising the monitor up or even tilting it all the way down. Once you have the monitor configured and everything plugged in, it’s quite easy to use for day to day operations.</p><p> The overall design of the ports and the location of these ports is for a minimalist design with the look of many items, such as cords and empty ports hidden away from view. Most of the settings and button features can be found along the side of the monitor where they can sometimes be hidden from view. When using the monitor in portrait mode these ports become much more accessible. For most high-end monitors, these types of ports are expected but it’s tough to find too many monitors that have such a wealth of ports available for use at one time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884002/19272" target="_top" id="1884002">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1884002" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1884002/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Features-and-Performance"><a href="#Features-and-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Features and Performance"></a>Features and Performance</h2><h4 id="1-OSD-and-Settings"><a href="#1-OSD-and-Settings" class="headerlink" title="1.OSD and Settings"></a>1.OSD and Settings</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-proart-pa329q-osd.jpg"                      alt="asus-proart-pa329q-osd"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141680/17091" target="_top" id="2141680">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2141680" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141680/17091"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The overall settings are handled by joystick navigation through the large OSD. There are many color options including quick fit resolution, a full menu of color options, input selections, blue light filters calibration tools and more. For the most part, calibration can be done with splendid menus which are available just out of the box. Additional features can also be found throughout the menu to improve connectivity and the use of the menus throughout usage. There is even an option to create alignments based off of actual paper sizes so that you can create very precise editing and proofing on documents before they print.</p><p> There are eight different picture modes available throughout the settings including sRBG, Adobe RPG and a variety of other factory settings. Putting locks into the brightness as well as color can make sure that full adjustments stay through multiple shifts and working conditions. Blue light filters also come with four different options ensuring that you can get compensation based off of the types of color settings you work best with. The color menu adjustments include sliders for all six colors and under the advanced submenu, there are some fine tuning adjustments that you won’t find on many other types of professional monitors.</p><p> The remaining types of picture controls can be found throughout the image submenu which allows for adjustments in sharpness, overscan, aspect control toggles and more. The Vivid Pixel enhancement option also allows for improved contrast between dark and light objects across the screen. The dynamic feature will improve the range of shadows for animation work for example.</p><h4 id="2-Color-and-Image-Quality"><a href="#2-Color-and-Image-Quality" class="headerlink" title="2. Color and Image Quality"></a>2. Color and Image Quality</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-proart-pa329q-rgb.jpg"                      alt="asus-proart-pa329q-rgb"                ></p><p> Overall this is a monitor designed for professional use and includes a wide color gamut of 100% REC .709, 99.5% Adobe RGB, wide color gamut for vibrant images and more. There are color spaces for video editing in 2020 as well as true to life color reproduction.</p><p> What’s really incredible with the color and image quality is the full customization that is available to professionals. Through the menus, it’s possible to change brightness settings, calibrate for animation and improved contrast as well as deliver improved support for working within Adobe and other video editing and production suites.</p><p> This device can produce 1.0 7 billion colors with the chance to produce over 1024 shades of each primary color. The screen is made up of a 10-bit panel and there is a 14-bit lookup table for a huge color gamut. There is also amazing gamma correction and color recalculation to represent the differences between colors and to finally produce a true to life image based off of the closest specifications and measurements on a print product.</p><p> Overall the image quality and color quality is perfect especially when the settings are dialed in the only aspect where this monitor falls short however is with brightness uniformity. Even many of the top Asus monitors find difficulty with uniformity compensation throughout the monitor face and this makes brightness at a fixed level of premium. The pure resolution and the size of the monitor ensures that pixels are close to invisible and the antiglare matte coating on the monitor makes it easy to read and easy to see colors in a variety of different lighting settings.</p><h4 id="3-Calibration"><a href="#3-Calibration" class="headerlink" title="3. Calibration"></a>3. Calibration</h4><p> Overall this monitor is extremely easy to work on right out-of-the-box. The calibration technology on ASUS however has always been a cut above. The PA329Q delivers DCI PIII color space support. The device also comes with a factory data calibration sheet ensuring that artists and creative professionals can calibrate specifically for Adobe RGB modes, s RGB modes and the latest in industry standards. The ASUS proARt calibration technology software also comes with all of the latest presets for editing software worldwide. New standards and improvements can be constantly fed through the software to ensure improved performance results.</p><p> As well as the features the color calibration tools that ASUS included just in the menu with the PA329Q make it extremely easy to calibrate in its multiple picture modes as well as through advanced settings that can all be found on the monitor.</p><h4 id="4-Eye-Care-Mode"><a href="#4-Eye-Care-Mode" class="headerlink" title="4.Eye Care Mode"></a>4.Eye Care Mode</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-proart-pa329q-protect-flicker.jpg"                      alt="asus-proart-pa329q-protect-flicker"                ></p><p> In eye care mode the Asus offers a flicker free operation with a low blue light.

Tip 6: Use Blend IF"></a>6. Tip 6: Use Blend IF</h3><p>If you want to change the color of leaves on a tree, you can use the “Blend IF” option of Adobe Photoshop to precisely do the changes. Start with duplicating the existing layer and then hiding the second layer. Double click on the layer to open the menu and then use “Blend IF” sliders. This option works when you drag the sliders to black points, and it automatically hides the dark pixels of your photo.</p><p>Similarly, if you drag the “Blend IF” sliders towards white pints, it can hide the light pixels. To hide any specific color from the picture, you can click on “Channels” and then select the color you want to eradicate completely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-photo-color-9.jpg"                      alt="select the channel color"                ></p><p>This method only hides color based on their luminance values; however, this loads the entire layer when loading the active pixels. Regardless, this can be changed into transparency. For this, you need to select the layer by right-clicking and selecting the option of “Convert to Smart Object.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-photo-color-10.jpg"                      alt="convert to smart object"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130531/26400" target="_top" id="2130531">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130531" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130531/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>It helps the user create transparency across the layer.

Well, they use creative assets known as vector art. Although the term may sound alien to you, it is common within creative circles, especially among professionals who use editing software in post-production.</p><p>The following is an overview of what vector art entails and why you should consider it for your next project. In addition, you will also find recommendations for the best free vector art and graphics websites to source for creative assets. Keep reading to discover more.</p><h2 id="Part1-How-to-Make-Good-Use-of-Vector-art"><a href="#Part1-How-to-Make-Good-Use-of-Vector-art" class="headerlink" title="Part1: How to Make Good Use of Vector art?"></a>Part1: How to Make Good Use of Vector art?</h2><p>So, what is vector art? Vector art is a creative term to describe images and illustrations you can easily modify without compromising their quality. For example, you can resize vector graphics to fit a billboard print without pixelating the original file. In addition, creating vector art involves using mathematical algorithms to create visual images on software such as Draw and Adobe Illustrator.</p><p>Furthermore, vector art results from using geometrical shapes to create images on a coordinate system. Typically, you represent each image point using a pair of numerical coordinates to indicate their distance from two fixed perpendicular lines. In addition, both fixed lines use a similar unit of length to determine the distance. As such, your origin point will always represent by coordinates 0,0.</p><p>The following are the common terms that vector art creators use in their work:</p><ul><li>Point</li></ul><p>The term refers to an exact location in the creative space. In addition, a point does not have length, width, or thickness dimensions. Instead, you represent it using numerical coordinates on a cartesian plane. For example, coordinates 0,0 represent the origin point on a 2D creative plane.</p><ul><li>Line</li></ul><p>A line is a segment of the creative space bound by two endpoints. In addition, you can represent it as a closed line segment where you indicate both endpoints or an open line segment that excludes the endpoints.</p><ul><li>Curves</li></ul><p>Conversely, curves are non-straight segments of your creative space. In addition, you use them to trace moving points in your creative space. For example, creators use parabolas to represent curves in their vector art.</p><ul><li>Polygons</li></ul><p>These images on your creative space have a specific number of connecting endpoints. For example, a triangle is a polygon with three connecting endpoints. In addition, you can create self-intersecting polygons where the image boundary crosses over itself. Star polygons are the most common example of self-intersecting polygons.</p><p>Vector art is best for creative works in the following categories:</p><ul><li>Album Covers.</li><li>Movie Posters.</li><li>Video Games.</li><li>Printed Ads.</li><li>Branded merchandise that features your logo.</li></ul><h2 id="Part2-Best-Free-vectors-websites-recommendations"><a href="#Part2-Best-Free-vectors-websites-recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Best Free vectors websites recommendations"></a>Part2: Best Free vectors websites recommendations</h2><p>Now that you know what vector art entails, here is a list of the best free vector websites you should check out.

All the memes that you can find on all these sites are available to download and edit. If you want to create a meme from scratch, you can download the meme template and use a photo editor to change all aspects of the template.</p><h2 id="Canva-Meme-Theme"><a href="#Canva-Meme-Theme" class="headerlink" title="Canva Meme Theme"></a>Canva Meme Theme</h2><p>Canva is one of the most popular photo editing tools in the market and one of the things that Canva users love about this platform is the availability of templates. There is a meme template on Canva for any type of meme that you would like to create and once you have settled on the meme that you would like to use, you can then use the Canva editor to customize it as desired.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/canva-meme-theme.jpg"                      alt="canva meme theme"                ></p><p>Canva makes it very easy to find the template you need as the templates are arranged under various categories. You can also use various filters including filters, style, theme, price, and color to find the perfect template. Most of the themes on Canva are free but there are some advanced templates that you can access on a paid subscription or for a one-time fee.</p><p>The Canva editor has a lot of different features to allow you to edit your selected template in various ways. You can change the color, text font, and images or even re-orient the entire template so you end up with a unique meme to suit your needs.</p><h2 id="Kapwing-Meme-Templates"><a href="#Kapwing-Meme-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Kapwing Meme Templates"></a>Kapwing Meme Templates</h2><p>Kapwing is another online photo editing tool that also comes with a built-in meme generator. One of the benefits of choosing Kapwing is the numerous templates that you can use to create a unique meme. Each of the templates that you find on Kapwing is completely customizable. You can change the color of the existing images, add your images, change the text font and color and even remove or replace the meme’s background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/kapwing-meme-templates.jpg"                      alt="kapwing meme templates"                ></p><p>Kapwing also makes it easy for you to find the templates that you need. All available templates on Kapwing are neatly arranged in various categories. The “Trending Now” category allows you to find memes that are relevant to the current market and may get you the best engagement.</p><h2 id="Adobe-Meme-Templates"><a href="#Adobe-Meme-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Adobe Meme Templates"></a>Adobe Meme Templates</h2><p>If you are looking to create unique and high-quality memes, Adobe Express is one of the best tools to use. This is an online photo editing tool from Adobe that can be used to generate memes very easily. While you can use Adobe Express to create a meme from scratch, the easiest way to create a meme is to choose from the numerous templates on the site.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/adobe-meme-templates.jpg"                      alt="adobe meme templates"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902319/19272" target="_top" id="1902319">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902319" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902319/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Once you choose a template, you can use Adobe Express to make changes to the template in various ways. This photo editor has a lot of features to help you make changes to the meme including editing the photos by replacing them with your images, editing the text by changing the font, and even changing the size of the entire meme.</p><p>The only problem with the meme templates that you find on Adobe Express is that they are not very well arranged. The home page is a list of templates of various genres and themes and you may find that it is quite a chore to find the unique template that you would like to use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087390/7443" target="_top" id="2087390">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087390" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087390/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ImgFlip-Meme-Template"><a href="#ImgFlip-Meme-Template" class="headerlink" title="ImgFlip Meme Template"></a>ImgFlip Meme Template</h2><p>If you are not looking to create highly sophisticated memes, ImgFlip is a great simple solution that you can use. There are thousands of meme templates to choose from, arranged in various genres and themes. Since the templates are added every day, the site has a very convenient search function that you can use to find the most reliable meme for your project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/imgflip-meme-template.jpg"                      alt="imgflip meme template"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139109/17108" target="_top" id="2139109">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139109" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139109/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>But ImgFlip is not a complete photos editor, meaning that you may not able to change the template too much. The only thing you can do with this tool is to change the caption o the template which can be valuable if you find the right meme template. Once the caption has been added, you can then download the completed meme and then upload it to various social media sites.</p><h2 id="Wepik-Meme-Templates"><a href="#Wepik-Meme-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Wepik Meme Templates"></a>Wepik Meme Templates</h2><p>Wepik is another great site if you are looking for different types of memes to use. There are thousands of memes that you can choose from and they are updated every day, giving you a wide variety of choices. The most popular and the newest meme templates are available on the first page, but you can also use the search function to find a particular meme template that may not be on the home page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/wepik-meme-templates.jpg"                      alt="wepik meme templates"                ></p><p>Once you have selected the meme that you want to use, Wepik shows you details about the template you have chosen. You can then use the Wepik editor to customize the template in various ways. You can use numerous tools to change the color of the meme, edit the text on the meme or even edit the image. Once you are happy with the changes, you can then download the meme to post to your social media pages.</p><h2 id="Knowledge-of-Meme-Templates"><a href="#Knowledge-of-Meme-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Knowledge of Meme Templates"></a>Knowledge of Meme Templates</h2><p><strong>1. Copyright of Free Meme Templates</strong></p><p>Like every other type of content that you may see online, memes (even free meme templates) are copyrighted. But the reason you don’t hear about this is that meme copyright infringement is rarely enforced. Memes are relatively easy to create and cost next to nothing so pursuing litigation in copyright infringement may not be worth the cost. They are also widely available and it is difficult to figure out where they originated from.</p><p>If you are worried about the legal implications of using a free meme template, you can credit the creator of the meme whenever you use it. But because it can often be difficult to find out who created the meme, this may be very difficult. The only way to overcome these legal challenges may be to use some of the meme templates on this page to create your own meme that will be unique to you.</p><p><strong>2. Trending Meme Topics</strong></p><p>You may notice that memes constantly change and a meme that was popular yesterday, may not be very popular today.
