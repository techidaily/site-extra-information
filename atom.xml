By making use of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GoPro Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you will be able to add a lot of creative touches to your video. In today’s post we are about to discuss how to do the perfect color correction on GoPro Studio and how to edit the footage captured on your action camera.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Color Grading and Correction in Final Cut Pro &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Color-Correction-in-GoPro-Studio"><a href="#Color-Correction-in-GoPro-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Color Correction in GoPro Studio"></a>Color Correction in GoPro Studio</h2><p> One of the easiest and most convenient ways of making the most out of your action camera is to use the <a class="link"   href="https://gopro.com/support/articles/how-to-use-protune" >“Protune” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> setting. The Protune among other things is capable of enhancing the dynamic recording range. The enhanced dynamic range would offer you a flat log like image which appears more vigorous while during color grading.</p><p> No matter whether you are recording with Protune turned on or off, you will be required to adjust the colors during the time of the edit. Color Correction in GoPro Studio is simple and intuitive.</p><p> Just follow the steps below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first thing you have to do is setting the cam to the Protune shooting mode. Now just import and get your Protune footage converted.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Split the Image- On the right of the screen there is a split button. You need to shift the point almost halfway. Doing this would split the window in ½ though you will not be able to see that. When the color profile of the image is changed the right side is going to change without affecting the left side. This would allow you to compare the image as it was before and after correcting the color. In order to view the original image or the edited one you have to draw the pointer to the right or left.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-gopro-studio-0.jpg"                      alt="Color correction in GoPro Studio"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Color Correction- On the right hand side of your window the color correction can be done just by hitting on the arrow beside the White Balance button and the Image button. Now you can see the options which needed to be changed in order to correct the color. You will be able to view all the options like temperature, exposure, sharpness, contrast, tint and saturation. You can also choose to apply different preset overlays to give the footage a special filter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-gopro-studio-1.jpg"                      alt="how to do color correction in GoPro Studio"                ></p><p> The GoPro Studio is very user friendly and effective video editing software but in order to use it you need to convert the format of your video before you start to edit. There aren’t many options especially when you require enhanced controls on the GoPro recordings. This is why we would recommend you to use the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> editing software. It is equipped with a special action cam tool which not only allows the user to alter the color by changing the brightness, saturation, vignette, tint or temp but even comes with loads of 3D LUT filters which adds a nice effect.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p> The all new version of the Wondershare Filmora editing software for Windows and Mac is packed with exciting features meant exclusively for action cameras.

To guide you through the process, we’ll explain the basics of color and outline the best color editing software packages and apps for fine-tuning the colors in your footage.</em></p><p>Color sorting is an exciting practice of patience, skillful tinkering, and a feeling for atmosphere. Creating stellar looks for a photo or video is a fun way to create a visual experience while maintaining a level of artistic integrity. While advanced artists may prefer larger software programs like Adobe Premiere or DaVinci Resolve, there are excellent, simpler applications built entirely for beginners. In fact, you don’t have to be a beginner to use these apps, as many of them use more manual controls for precise adjustments. The advancements readily available for iOS and iPad these days are stellar, and we’re here to help point you in the right direction.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-color-correction"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-color-correction" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is color correction?"></a>Part 1. What is color correction?</h2><p>Color correction refers to the process of adjusting each clip of footage to meet a consistent standard of appearance. Basically, it’s about correcting the underlying image issues by balancing the colors, making white appear white, black appear black, and making sure everything is even. The goal is to match the video footage to a standard that would accurately represent how the human eye would see it.</p><p>An example of this is when you are shooting outdoors during the day. During the day, the quality of the sun will change, and some shots of your video will not match. This is why color correction is important because it will make your video look like it was all shot at the same time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-app-1.jpg"                      alt="color grading app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2112007/7443" target="_top" id="2112007">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2112007" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2112007/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Best-color-correction-app"><a href="#Part-2-Best-color-correction-app" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Flash-Frame-Filmmaking-Script"><a href="#Flash-Frame-Filmmaking-Script" class="headerlink" title="Flash Frame Filmmaking Script"></a>Flash Frame Filmmaking Script</h2><p>Short films are becoming more and more popular with seasoned filmmakers, breakout filmmakers, and students alike. Search on YouTube and you’ll find thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of short film examples. But what makes for a good short <a class="link"   href="https://blog.celtx.com/write-the-script-5-basic-steps/" >film script <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? How can you make it stand out from the crowd?</p><p>Today, we look at seven important aspects of a great short film script and how you can improve yours. Can you put these into practice when writing your next script?</p><h2 id="Part-1-7-tips-for-improving-short-film-scripts"><a href="#Part-1-7-tips-for-improving-short-film-scripts" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. 7 tips for improving short film scripts"></a>Part 1. 7 tips for improving short film scripts</h2><p>There’s never been a better time to learn the craft of writing short film scripts. Interest and access to creating and viewing short films and series episodes have exploded worldwide, both on television and on the web. A great short film can also open doors for you into the film industry, as Barry Jenkins discovered with his great screenplay for the short film My Josephine, which I wrote in my screenwriting class at Florida State University.</p><p>But writing a successful short script is not easy. It requires the craft and concentration of a medieval artist carving scenes into walnut. So here are seven tips for creating a short script.</p><h3 id="1-Storyline"><a href="#1-Storyline" class="headerlink" title="1. Storyline"></a>1. Storyline</h3><p>This is always, always, the number one problem for my screenwriting students. They come up with big story ideas, often feature screenplay ideas, but quickly find that their idea doesn’t fit or work in short form. The result is what I call “narrative cramming.” The story can’t breathe. So, you need an idea that is small, specific, and significant to your main character.</p><p><strong><em>My Josephine</em></strong> was inspired by “an image of two people’s legs hanging over a table in my head,” according to Barry Jenkins. I saw them, young and intimate, working the night shift in a 24-hour laundry.” Even with this small, simple, and significant image as a starting point for a short script, Barry struggled to find a story in six pages that he could tell well. He attempted to include the murder in the Laundromat at one point, which resulted in, yes, narrative cramming. Barry rewrote the script a year later and “made it as simple as I could as a writer,” he told me. I was so moved by his transcript that I only wrote three words in the script – “Beautiful and gentle”. Just like his beautiful film.</p><h3 id="2-Characterization"><a href="#2-Characterization" class="headerlink" title="2. Characterization"></a>2. Characterization</h3><p>Writing compelling short scripts requires what Thornton Wilder called “shortcuts to the imagination.” And knowing what your main character wants in your story is the most important shortcut to understanding and discovering who your main character is. So, give your main character a desire or yearning for something that matters deeply to her. Then let your story flow from your character’s efforts to achieve that wish. The best stories, short or long, are about the human heart.</p><h3 id="3-An-independent-story"><a href="#3-An-independent-story" class="headerlink" title="3. An independent story"></a>3. An independent story</h3><p>It’s also a useful way to think of the script as an energy system, as William Gibson brilliantly says in Shakespeare’s play. An energy system begins with an Inciting Incident - a significant event&#x2F;discovery that unleashes the energy system - and ends with a Climax - the moment when the story’s outcome is known, and the energy system ends. Given the limited number of pages available in your short script, it’s essential that your inciting incident appears on the first page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/short-film-script-example-1.jpg"                      alt="an independent story"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2139322/26400" target="_top" id="2139322">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2139322" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2139322/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006941/19272" target="_top" id="2006941">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006941" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006941/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Conflict"><a href="#4-Conflict" class="headerlink" title="4. Conflict"></a>4. Conflict</h3><p>Conflict is every point of opposition between two forces (physical or intellectual), as well as the consequences of this opposition - all in full view of what can be seen on the screen, whether through cinema, television, or devices.</p><p>Screenwriters can’t convey conflict with background and inner thoughts or explanations of inner thoughts—that’s literary conflict.</p><p>Instead, screenwriters are tasked with presenting the conflict on screen through scene descriptions, character actions and reactions, and dialogue. While the dialogue is something we hear and could certainly—in smaller print—be used to replace literary prose to describe background information, backstory, and inner thoughts, the best screenplays and movies show rather than tell.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/short-film-script-example-2.jpg"                      alt="conflict"                ></p><h3 id="5-Turning-Point"><a href="#5-Turning-Point" class="headerlink" title="5. Turning Point"></a>5. Turning Point</h3><p>It’s helpful to think of a screenplay as a pattern of significant human change that you create at specific moments of change—the discoveries and decisions your main character makes that change the character and move the story forward. What your character wants and is trying to achieve in your short is the surface action – the events we see on screen. And how these events forever change a character’s inner landscape is deep action—your character arc.</p><p>If you want to see a well-crafted surface and deep action&#x2F;character arc in a fifteen-page script, read Chapter 17 <em>“Killer Kart”</em> in the book Making Short Scripts That Connect 5e, and screen the movie on the book’s website. It’s no surprise that the film is the most screened film ever made at the FSU Film School.</p><h3 id="6-Sublimation"><a href="#6-Sublimation" class="headerlink" title="6. Sublimation"></a>6. Sublimation</h3><p>Scenes are the <strong>“church of drama”</strong>, as William Gibson also brilliantly says. So, it’s helpful to think of your scenes as the time and place where a significant moment of change will occur, throwing your script into the next scene and moving your story forward. That is your purpose when you write a scene, to dramatize the moment (or moments) of change. That’s what matters. I like to think of a scene as an oyster and a moment of change as a pearl. Then cut to your scenes as close to the moment of change as possible and exit as soon as possible.</p><p>I got it, really got it, as a young playwright when the Actors Theater of Louisville commissioned me to write a ten-minute play. And I did—in six scenes that I hit late and left early, each with a small but significant moment of change that moved the story into the next scene. “A tender and effortless glissando that gracefully stretches from moment to wistful moment,” as The Los Angeles Times put it in my all-time favorite review.</p><h3 id="7-Ending"><a href="#7-Ending" class="headerlink" title="7. Ending"></a>7. Ending</h3><p>The end of a script is often more important than the 90 pages that preceded it. Because of the magnitude of its importance, many writers struggle to close their scripts with the right resolution. But don’t worry, we’ll show you everything you need to know about how to end a storyboard with examples of basic storyboard formats from Star Wars: <strong><em>The Force Awakens</em></strong> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/"><strong><em>The Big Short</em></strong></a>. We will discuss the technical aspects of writing THE END into scripts. By the end, you’ll have a good understanding of the formatting requirements for how to end the script.</p><p><strong>Example Script Defining Above Tips</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/short-film-script-example-3.jpg"                      alt="example script defining"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139107/17108" target="_top" id="2139107">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139107" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139107/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-edit-your-short-film"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-edit-your-short-film" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Characterization<p>Writing compelling short scripts requires what Thornton Wilder called “shortcuts to the imagination.” And knowing what your main character wants in your story is the most important shortcut to understanding and discovering who your main character is. So, give your main character a desire or yearning for something that matters deeply to her. Then let your story flow from your character’s efforts to achieve that wish. The best stories, short or long, are about the human heart.</p><h3 id="3-An-independent-story-1"><a href="#3-An-independent-story-1" class="headerlink" title="3. An independent story"></a>3. An independent story</h3><p>It’s also a useful way to think of the script as an energy system, as William Gibson brilliantly says in Shakespeare’s play. An energy system begins with an Inciting Incident - a significant event&#x2F;discovery that unleashes the energy system - and ends with a Climax - the moment when the story’s outcome is known, and the energy system ends. Given the limited number of pages available in your short script, it’s essential that your inciting incident appears on the first page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/short-film-script-example-1.jpg"                      alt="an independent story"                ></p><h3 id="4-Conflict-1"><a href="#4-Conflict-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Conflict"></a>4. Conflict</h3><p>Conflict is every point of opposition between two forces (physical or intellectual), as well as the consequences of this opposition - all in full view of what can be seen on the screen, whether through cinema, television, or devices.</p><p>Screenwriters can’t convey conflict with background and inner thoughts or explanations of inner thoughts—that’s literary conflict.</p><p>Instead, screenwriters are tasked with presenting the conflict on screen through scene descriptions, character actions and reactions, and dialogue. While the dialogue is something we hear and could certainly—in smaller print—be used to replace literary prose to describe background information, backstory, and inner thoughts, the best screenplays and movies show rather than tell.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/short-film-script-example-2.jpg"                      alt="conflict"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139114/17108" target="_top" id="2139114">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139114" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139114/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Turning-Point-1"><a href="#5-Turning-Point-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Turning Point"></a>5. Turning Point</h3><p>It’s helpful to think of a screenplay as a pattern of significant human change that you create at specific moments of change—the discoveries and decisions your main character makes that change the character and move the story forward. What your character wants and is trying to achieve in your short is the surface action – the events we see on screen. And how these events forever change a character’s inner landscape is deep action—your character arc.</p><p>If you want to see a well-crafted surface and deep action&#x2F;character arc in a fifteen-page script, read Chapter 17 <em>“Killer Kart”</em> in the book Making Short Scripts That Connect 5e, and screen the movie on the book’s website. It’s no surprise that the film is the most screened film ever made at the FSU Film School.</p><h3 id="6-Sublimation-1"><a href="#6-Sublimation-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Sublimation"></a>6. Sublimation</h3><p>Scenes are the <strong>“church of drama”</strong>, as William Gibson also brilliantly says. So, it’s helpful to think of your scenes as the time and place where a significant moment of change will occur, throwing your script into the next scene and moving your story forward. That is your purpose when you write a scene, to dramatize the moment (or moments) of change. That’s what matters. I like to think of a scene as an oyster and a moment of change as a pearl. Then cut to your scenes as close to the moment of change as possible and exit as soon as possible.</p><p>I got it, really got it, as a young playwright when the Actors Theater of Louisville commissioned me to write a ten-minute play. And I did—in six scenes that I hit late and left early, each with a small but significant moment of change that moved the story into the next scene. “A tender and effortless glissando that gracefully stretches from moment to wistful moment,” as The Los Angeles Times put it in my all-time favorite review.</p><h3 id="7-Ending-1"><a href="#7-Ending-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Ending"></a>7. Ending</h3><p>The end of a script is often more important than the 90 pages that preceded it. Because of the magnitude of its importance, many writers struggle to close their scripts with the right resolution. But don’t worry, we’ll show you everything you need to know about how to end a storyboard with examples of basic storyboard formats from Star Wars: <strong><em>The Force Awakens</em></strong> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/"><strong><em>The Big Short</em></strong></a>. We will discuss the technical aspects of writing THE END into scripts. By the end, you’ll have a good understanding of the formatting requirements for how to end the script.</p><p><strong>Example Script Defining Above Tips</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/short-film-script-example-3.jpg"                      alt="example script defining"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135354/19272" target="_top" id="2135354">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135354" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135354/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-edit-your-short-film-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-edit-your-short-film-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) sufferers report the sensation as extremely calming, with a static feeling over the head, back of the neck, shoulders, and sometimes elsewhere in the body. People have likened it and connected it to the frisson or shivers many experiences while listening to music. On the other hand, ASMR is elicited by crisp or quiet noises, either alone or in combination with conservative movement or personal attention. Some ASMR-inducing films incorporate visual clues, which seem to influence the reactions of some individuals.</p><p>Whether you’ve used ASMR to help you sleep in the past or you love its potential advantages, it’s worth researching how it works and the best <strong>ASMR for sleep</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/asmr-for-sleep-1.jpg"                      alt="asmr for sleep"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-does-ASMR-help-you-sleep"><a href="#Part-1-Why-does-ASMR-help-you-sleep" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why does ASMR help you sleep?"></a>Part 1: Why does ASMR help you sleep?</h2><p>Due to the recent discovery of <strong>ASMR sleep videos</strong>, research into its mechanism is still in its infancy. Researchers have assumptions about how ASMR works, and the conducted research gives fascinating data.</p><p>Researchers did <a class="link"   href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6209833/" >fMRI brain scans <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on participants experiencing ASMR in one investigation. During the ASMR tingle, participants in the research demonstrated activity across their brains, known as whole brain activation. There was also intense activity in the brain region involved with self-awareness, social comprehension, and social movements in nonhuman primates, including grooming behaviors. Because the effects of <strong>ASMR for sleep</strong> are comparable to those of social grooming in monkeys, the researchers hypothesized that it might be a grooming response that survived evolution.</p><p>So, <strong>does ASMR help you sleep</strong>? Let us find the answer in the subsequent paragraphs.</p><p>ASMR is a social reaction, which explains why it increases feelings of comfort, relaxation, and drowsiness. ASMR engages brain parts connected with chemicals such as dopamine, oxytocin, and endorphins, which may boost these experiences. It may also explain why some personality traits, particularly openness to new experiences, seem to enhance the likelihood of someone having ASMR.</p><p>ASMR, on the other hand, maybe more sophisticated than this idea predicts. While most individuals who experience ASMR find it calming, it also tends to cause heightened excitement and non-sexual physiological arousal. Nostalgia is a complicated experience that could be both pleasant and sad, and ASMR may be a complex reaction that is both relaxing and exciting. ASMR links with brain connectivity. According to one research, persons with it have diminished functional connectivity or a typical connection in particular brain parts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/asmr-for-sleep-2.jpg"                      alt="asmr help you sleep"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-ASMR-Channels-for-Sleep"><a href="#Part-2-Best-ASMR-Channels-for-Sleep" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best ASMR Channels for Sleep"></a>Part 2: Best ASMR Channels for Sleep</h2><p>Although not everyone, most individuals tend to experience ASMR for the first time between the ages of 5 and 10, though some people experience it later in life. Although ASMR is a relatively recent phenomenon, individuals have been experiencing it for quite some time. Here are the best <strong>ASMR channels for sleep</strong> in terms of different categories.</p><h3 id="1-Talking-ASMR"><a href="#1-Talking-ASMR" class="headerlink" title="1. Talking ASMR"></a>1.

Even silent phone vibrations might disrupt sleep. (30 dB might interrupt sleep) Even if you don’t wake up, it may create a lighter sleep period, leaving you unrested. Before bed, set “do not disturb.” During the stated time, it mutes calls, emails, and notifications—no ringing or buzzing. The content continues without warning. In an emergency, you may customize the mode to accept specific calls.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/asmr-for-sleep-8.jpg"                      alt="turn off notification"                ></p><h3 id="2-Turn-off-YouTube-autoplay"><a href="#2-Turn-off-YouTube-autoplay" class="headerlink" title="2.

When you turn on autoplay, the following relevant video in the playlist will begin playing automatically when the previous video finishes playing. It continues playing videos, so you don’t have to choose a new video to view once the one you’re watching stops playing. To maximize <strong>ASMR sleep</strong>, you can switch off autoplay and avoid the discomfort of having to search for the back button to halt unwanted music frantically.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/asmr-for-sleep-9.jpg"                      alt="turn off youtube auto play"                ></p><h3 id="3-Stop-finding-the-best-sleeping-position-and-focus-on-the-ASMR"><a href="#3-Stop-finding-the-best-sleeping-position-and-focus-on-the-ASMR" class="headerlink" title="3.

Stop finding the best sleeping position and focus on the ASMR</h3><p>Instead of finding a good sleeping posture, watch <strong>an ASMR sleep video</strong>.

How we use the light on our pictures is what makes these images unique and different from others, which is the reason why it is important to know which types of natural and artificial lights can help you improve the quality of your iPhone photos.</p><p>Being a photographer means that you must be able to use light to your own advantage and play with it to get better results, so in this article we are going to take you through a lot of different types of light and we are going to provide you with useful tips on how to use light in your photos.</p><h2 id="iPhone-Photography-Lighting-Tips-1"><a href="#iPhone-Photography-Lighting-Tips-1" class="headerlink" title="iPhone Photography Lighting Tips"></a>iPhone Photography Lighting Tips</h2><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Tips for Outdoor iPhone Photographers</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Tips for Indoor iPhone Photography Sessions</a></li></ul><h3 id="Tips-for-Outdoor-iPhone-Photographers"><a href="#Tips-for-Outdoor-iPhone-Photographers" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Outdoor iPhone Photographers"></a>Tips for Outdoor iPhone Photographers</h3><p><strong>1. Golden hour:</strong> Diffused light is much more pleasant for taking photos and the softest natural light can be found during the sunrise and sunset. The hour before the sun sets or rises is called the golden hour and it is one of the best times of the day for photography in terms of the quality of light that is available. Colors on photos taken during the golden hour appear warm and pictures have a lot of red, yellow or orange due to the low position of the sun on the horizon. Sunrise and sunset are also a perfect time of the day to capture silhouette photos or breathtaking landscapes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/golden-hour-photo.jpg"                      alt="golden-hour-photo"                ></p><p>Image resource: Constractly</p><p>Anyone who has seen a photo of a sunset knows how light during the golden hour looks like, but being able to capture such beautiful light requires you to use your iPhone as a photo camera frequently. If you constantly take pictures early in the morning or just before sunset you’ll be able to take your iPhone photography a step further.</p><p><strong>2. Blue hour:</strong> Around half an hour before the night ends or after the sunset there is still enough light to shoot amazing photos. During that narrow period of time, you can create stunning city vistas because the artificial light of metropolises creates a contrast to the sky in the background. The light during the blue hour is colder, which is why photos taken during the period tend to have more blues and greens.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blue-hour-photography.jpg"                      alt="blue-hour-photography"                ></p><p>Holding your phone in your hand while taking pictures during the blue hour may result in blurry photos because you have to set longer exposures in order to ensure your camera is getting enough light. Placing your iPhone on a tripod or on a surface on which it will be perfectly stable, will enable you to produce razor-sharp images with a lot of blue hour light.</p><p><strong>3. Midday:</strong> One hour before and after the noon and the Sun is at its highest point, which means that during this period of the day it provides the most light. The type of light the Sun produces at this time of the day is called direct light, that is much less diffused than the light in the morning. Even though there is enough light to take pictures while holding your iPhone, too much light can also create problems if you are using automatic settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/midday-lighting.jpg"                      alt="midday-lighting"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037345/7443" target="_top" id="2037345">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037345" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037345/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Image resource: flickr</p><p>The abundance of light puts you at risk of overexposing parts of your photo, and for that reason it is better to set the ISO, Aperture and Exposure values manually, using some of the iOS apps that enable you to control your iPhone camera settings. The direct light produces a strong contrast between light and shadow, that can create a great rhythm on a photo.</p><p><strong>4. Cloudy sky:</strong> Clouds can be photographer’s best friend and his or her’s worst enemy. A cloudy gray sky generates all sorts of problems to cameras because it is often much brighter than the rest of the scene. On the other hand, a blue sky with fluffy white clouds looks like the perfect background for a photo. This is a great example of how much outdoor photography depends on good weather conditions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cloudy-sky-lighting.jpg"                      alt="cloudy-sky-lighting"                ></p><p>Image resource: Digital Photo Secrets</p><p>Cloudy gray days allow you to take better black and white photos because the scenes you can take photos of, don’t have too much color. Monochrome photos are easier to take because unlike with color photos you only have to work with blacks and whites.</p><p>Color photos of a cloudy sky look better if the sky is clear and there are only a few cloud formations in the shot, and if you want to take photos of clouds you just have to be careful not to use zoom too much.</p><p><strong>5. Mist and Fog:</strong> Mist or fog has a tendency to diffuse light which makes the light more pleasant to the human eye, but the reduced visibility complicates taking pictures for a number of reasons. A great photo always depends on a good moment, so in order to make good use of mist, you have to be at a right location and at a right time. Early morning is the best time to experiment with light softened by fog because usually there is enough light so you can capture sunbeams as they fall on the scene before you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mist-fog-lighting.jpg"                      alt="mist-fog-lighting"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977023">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977023.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977023">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977023.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977023%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977023/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Image resource: Digital Photo Secrets</p><p>As rewarding as they may be, mist creates a lot of problems for iPhone photographers, because finding a focus point is more difficult than it is under normal light conditions. The light you can capture through the mist is truly magical, but it is often difficult to come across this type of light.</p><p><strong>6. Backlight:</strong> Commonly, photos receive most of the light from the light that falls from the front, but when the light falls from the back of the photo’s subject that means that the picture is backlit. The best example of the backlit photo is a silhouette photo, because most of the light in the photo comes from the source located behind the subject of a photo, thus making it possible to create a silhouette of a figure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-silhoutte-photo.jpg"                      alt="get-silhoutte-photo"                ></p><p>Image resource: Google</p><p>All you need to do in order to capitalize on backlight is to place the subject of the photo between the iPhone camera and a source of light. The light that’s coming directly towards camera will force you to reduce the camera’s exposure, which will create a dark figure on your photo. If you want to take great backlit photos, you need to learn how to use sources of light you have at your disposal. Use anything you can find, shop windows, street lamps or anything else that can help you take a better photo.</p><p><strong>7. Artificial light at night:</strong> Long exposure photography is an art that takes time to master, but being patient and willing to learn all its tricks will improve your photo taking skills. Using an artificial light at night can help you avoid using flash or tripods while taking photos with an iPhone. Even if there is a lot of artificial light in the scene you want to photograph, the stability of your camera should be your main concern because even the smallest camera shake can easily blur the photo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/artificial-light-outdoor.jpg"                      alt="artificial-light-outdoor"                ></p><p>Image resource: Efram Goldberg Photography</p><p>Rain creates reflections of artificial light on the streets at night, which is why if you like night photography, taking pictures at night after the rain is one of the best times for long exposure pictures. iPhones can capture amazing night shots, but they do need additional photo equipment to achieve their best results.</p><h3 id="Watch-Video-Tips-for-Taking-Photos-on-iPhone-in-Different-Lighting"><a href="#Watch-Video-Tips-for-Taking-Photos-on-iPhone-in-Different-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="Watch Video!

The light that falls at an angle produces shadows that add a sense of depth to the photo, thus creating an opportunity to take an artistic photo indoors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/artificial-light.jpg"                      alt="artificial-light"                ></p><p>However, artificial sources of light are usually a better option if you want to take interior photos since the natural sources of light are scarce and unreliable. Using a flash on your iPhone is also an option but its strong light will completely change the light setting of the scene.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111995/7443" target="_top" id="2111995">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111995" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111995/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-efficient-desktop-capture-for-windows-users/"><u>[New] In 2024, Efficient Desktop Capture for Windows Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-inside-look-how-mycam-shapes-your-visual-storytelling/"><u>[New] In 2024, Inside Look How MyCam Shapes Your Visual Storytelling</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-things-about-asmr-video-you-should-know/"><u>[New] In 2024, Things About ASMR Video You Should Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-6-tools-to-download-lite-videos-from-facebook/"><u>[New] In 2024, Top 6 Tools to Download Lite Videos From Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-leading-apps-for-dji-video-manipulation-and-mixing/"><u>[New] Leading Apps for DJi Video Manipulation and Mixing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-mastering-the-skies-with-xiaomis-4k-drone/"><u>[New] Mastering the Skies with Xiaomi's 4K Drone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-simple-strategies-for-capturing-games-on-consoles/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Simple Strategies for Capturing Games on Consoles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/audiovisual-excellence-on-youtube-through-enhancements/"><u>Audiovisual Excellence on YouTube Through Enhancements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/gimbal-excellence-markets-top-choices/"><u>Gimbal Excellence Market's Top Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/pixiz-techniques-to-fuse-images-and-movement-seamlessly/"><u>Pixiz Techniques to Fuse Images and Movement Seamlessly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/revolutionary-rendition-of-recording-link/"><u>Revolutionary Rendition of Recording Link</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/top-7-phone-number-locators-to-track-samsung-galaxy-f54-5g-location-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Top 7 Phone Number Locators To Track Samsung Galaxy F54 5G Location | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/unleash-next-level-gaming-with-a-1000-budget-building-an-rtx-4070-and-2tb-ssd-pc-via-prime-day-deals-the-ultimate-guide/"><u>Unleash Next-Level Gaming with a $1,000 Budget - Building an RTX 4070 & 2TB SSD PC via Prime Day Deals: The Ultimate Guide</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

A user may add another Flickr user as a contact after making an account with the website. This allows the user to construct a profile page that displays photographs and videos that the user has posted to the website.

Additionally, Flickr allows other users who have access to your photos to comment on them, “star” them and follow you to get updates on your photo uploads. You can get more out of your Flickr account by connecting it to third-party applications and sharing your photographs on social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Tumbler.

Flickr provides mobile users with official mobile applications for iOS and Android, in addition to a mobile site optimized for usage on mobile devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-cloud-storage-4.jpg"                      alt="flickr"                ></p><p><strong>Free 1000-picture storage</strong></p><p>Free <strong>cloud storage services</strong> for up to 1000 images and videos are available via Flickr. However, the restriction depends on the number of photographs rather than the storage size. You may upload your pictures in total, uncompressed splendor without worrying about conserving space.</p><p><strong>Unlimited storage for premium users.</strong></p><p>If you think that 1,000 images won’t be enough, you have the option to subscribe for simply $7.99 more each month. It is worth considering that it already provides unlimited storage and removes all advertisements from your experience. You will not need to update your system a second time to get an additional terabyte of storage space.</p><p><strong>Other features.</strong></p><p>Flickr provides a sharing link for images and albums and the ability to manage the groups of people who may see your photos. Additionally, Flickr allows other users who have access to your photos to comment on them, “star” them and follow you to get updates on your photo uploads. You can get more out of your Flickr account by connecting it to third-party applications and sharing your photographs on social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Tumbler. You can examine how many views your images have received and determine their credit rights.</p><h2 id="Part-3-The-Best-Cloud-Storage-Service-for-Videos-1"><a href="#Part-3-The-Best-Cloud-Storage-Service-for-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: The Best Cloud Storage Service for Videos"></a>Part 3: The Best Cloud Storage Service for Videos</h2><h3 id="Wondershare-Drive-1"><a href="#Wondershare-Drive-1" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Drive"></a>Wondershare Drive</h3><p>The Wondershare Drive is the <strong>best cloud storage</strong> platform that caters to those who create both work and content.

Plus, if you make changes to a file on one of your devices and then sync it to the others, the changes will take effect immediately.</p><p>In addition, extensive backup options make it possible to save anything from individual files and folders to create a whole image of your device, facilitating straightforward recovery in the event of a catastrophe. (If you have a terrible internet connection and the file will take a long time to download, IDrive can even give you a physical drive with all your data, which is a huge advantage.)</p><p>Two-factor authentication safeguards your account no matter what you’re up to, and end-to-end encryption makes it impossible for anybody to acquire even a whiff of the information you’ve stored there.</p><p>However, if you are not the technical type, don’t worry. You can set up IDrive in a matter of moments and forget it’s there, allowing the service to do its job. Highly configurable apps enable tweaking all low-level settings (bandwidth throttling, data verification), but if you aren’t the technical type, that’s okay too.</p><p>What’s more? Well, check out the fantastic new offer.</p><p>Get up to 90% off on 10 terabytes of storage space based on your region. You can also use the company’s free lifetime plan with 10 GB of storage space.

But, from a wide plethora of choices available on the internet to download for video editing, you could be confused regarding which one would be the best for you. That is why here in this article, we will talk about <strong>final-cut pro-plug-ins</strong> that can be downloaded from the internet free of cost or by paying.</p><p>If you are not aware of what plug-ins for final cut pro are. Then, let us take a brief look at them: - Third-party add-ons, called plug-ins, are tools used to enhance videos in final cut pro X. They can add new features to your final cut pro software that original developers didn’t include. Most plug-ins are created by ordinary people to enhance their work and are sometimes shared on the internet for free or at a fee.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Fx factory pro</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">mLUT</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Color Finale 2.0</a></li><li><a href="#part1-4">NewBlueFX</a></li><li><a href="#part1-5">Movie Pop</a></li><li><a href="#part1-6">Free XEffects Matrix Plugin</a></li><li><a href="#part1-7">Motion blur plug-in</a></li><li><a href="#part1-8">Free data pop</a></li><li><a href="#part1-9">Distortion effects</a></li><li><a href="#part1-10">Shutter shock FCPX plug-in</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">Part 2.

Best Final Cut Pro Plug-Ins"></a>Part 1. Best Final Cut Pro Plug-Ins</h2><h3 id="1-Fx-factory-pro"><a href="#1-Fx-factory-pro" class="headerlink" title="1. Fx factory pro"></a>1. Fx factory pro</h3><p>Fx factory pro is one of the <strong>best final cut pro plug ins</strong> that users can try for free to access if the plug-in is suited to their video editing work. But while using the trials, fx factory pro would watermark the video, although, after purchase, it gets removed. Users can easily download it from the Fx factory website, and its smooth layout will help you quickly navigate its homepage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/fx-factory-pro.jpg"                      alt="fx factory pro"                ></p><p>If you are thinking about fx factory pro integration with <strong>fcpx plug-ins</strong>, you need not worry about that because the coordination between the two is off-charts. Many professionals looking for video editing websites consider Fx factory as their ideal destination for choosing plug-ins for their work.</p><h3 id="2-mLUT"><a href="#2-mLUT" class="headerlink" title="2. mLUT"></a>2. mLUT</h3><p>Are you not satisfied with final cut pro X color grading software even though you don’t necessarily hate it but want to see improvements in it? That’s where the mLUT plug-in of motion VFX comes into the picture. Ideally, it is a free plug-in that video editors can use to look up their tables in one place together. One of the eye-catching features of mLUT from Motion VFX would ask your video to be shot in a longer format to get the best out of your color grading capabilities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/mlut-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="mlut plug in"                ></p><p>If you want to add more to your video editing, the paid version of mLUT packs offered by Motion VFX will allow you to add a cinematic look to your video efficiently. After all this, you find your video or image not perfect, so make sure you keep using it.</p><h3 id="3-Color-Finale-2-0"><a href="#3-Color-Finale-2-0" class="headerlink" title="3. Color Finale 2.0"></a>3. Color Finale 2.0</h3><p>Most people using final cut pro X were somewhat unsatisfied with the internally practical fast color correction tools. It was always about having something that properly allowed video color grading workflow. That is when color finale 2.0, a newer version of the initially released color finale, is known to come in handy. It is a new and more improved version of the previous one, which is optimized for having metal and more color management features such as ACES.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/color-finale-2-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="color finale 2 plug in"                ></p><p>From the beginning, the color finale was designed as a plug-in for the final cut pro-X. It offers the users two options: go for the standard one or pro to enjoy more features like tangent panel control, group grading, ACES color space, film grain simulation, and mask tracking.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115932/19272" target="_top" id="2115932">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115932" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115932/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-NewBlueFX"><a href="#4-NewBlueFX" class="headerlink" title="4. NewBlueFX"></a>4. NewBlueFX</h3><p>Suppose you are looking for a compatible video editing program like adobe after effects, premiere pro, and some other software like it. Then, a new blue FX that provides an alternative to critical aspects like framing, masking, and offering necessary plug-ins to improve the videos and eliminate other challenges could be the choice for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/new-blue-fx-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="new blue fx plug in"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151869/7443" target="_top" id="2151869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>There are many plug-ins offered in New blue fx, and each has features that push forward for its improvement every day. The zoom effects or auto-pan plug-in could be your solution when adding some still motion or picture into your video. It identifies the significant highs and lows of the video or image, changes the detail, and contrasts automatically whenever or wherever needed.</p><h3 id="5-Movie-Pop"><a href="#5-Movie-Pop" class="headerlink" title="5. Movie Pop"></a>5. Movie Pop</h3><p>Do you consider you’re a crazy fan of movies, and being a video creator, you are always on the move on how to recreate those famous movie sequences that you watched in movie halls or on your computer? Then, the movie could be the perfect plug-in, ideally serving this kind of situation. It is considered the easiest to recreate those title sequences of the favorite movies you want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/movie-pop-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="movie pop plug in"                ></p><p>If you want something more out of these <strong>final cut plug</strong>-<strong>ins</strong>, add your recreation of the title. Then, unfortunately, it won’t be able to offer you those because movie pop developed by stupid raisins was made for the above work only and nothing more. It is a free plug-in that editors can download from the internet.</p><h3 id="6-Free-XEffects-Matrix-Plugin"><a href="#6-Free-XEffects-Matrix-Plugin" class="headerlink" title="6. Free XEffects Matrix Plugin"></a>6. Free XEffects Matrix Plugin</h3><p>If you are a big fan of the matrix trilogy and want to add a specific green cascading effect into your video, then the free X effects matrix plug-in will offer you that. Instead, searching from numerous plug-ins available on the internet for adding this special effect matrix plug-in will ensure the work is done for you as per your need.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/free-xeffects-matrix-plugin.jpg"                      alt="free xeffects matrix plugin"                ></p><p>It would specifically save a lot of time and energy for you that can be used for some other purposes that are in more of its need. The process is also quite simple:</p><ul><li>Entering the main title text</li><li>Adjusting the color density according to your specification</li><li>The text’s speed and ideal position</li></ul><p>After completing these above steps, your plug-in will be built automatically.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975807/19272" target="_top" id="1975807">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975807" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975807/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Motion-blur-plug-in"><a href="#7-Motion-blur-plug-in" class="headerlink" title="7.

Next would be the circular zig-zag, a ripple-type effect that doubles the amount of refraction on the image. And lastly, the twirl effect twists your clip to a certain degree to move it from subtle to extreme points.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135360/19272" target="_top" id="2135360">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135360" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135360/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="10-Shutter-shock-FCPX-plug-in"><a href="#10-Shutter-shock-FCPX-plug-in" class="headerlink" title="10.

What Is an Podcast RSS Feed?"></a>Part 1. What Is an Podcast RSS Feed?</h2><p>RSS, Really Simple Syndication, has been around for quite a long time (since 1999), and it was introduced to allow internet users to stay connected with their favorite websites. In other words, it’s used to subscribe to news websites, emails, blogs, podcasts, etc. It is just a simple link looking like this:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-1.jpg"                      alt="rss feed"                ></p><p>Your Podcast RSS feed makes the information about your podcast quickly accessible on various podcast directories, like Apple Podcast and Spotify. Yes, it holds the information about your podcast show and its episodes. So, whenever you create a new episode on the hosting website, it automatically updates it to podcast directories in real-time, thus making it accessible to listeners at their convenience.</p><p>Ultimately, an RSS feed saves you the stress of manually uploading new episodes of your podcast to various platforms! An RSS feed could also be referred to as;</p><ul><li>RSS channel</li><li>Newsfeed</li><li>RSS stream</li><li>Web feed</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-When-to-Use-an-RSS-Feed"><a href="#Part-2-When-to-Use-an-RSS-Feed" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. When to Use an RSS Feed"></a>Part 2. When to Use an RSS Feed</h2><p>The concept of an RSS feed is pretty simple. It is what bridges the gap between your content and internet users. It means it’s not only helpful to podcasters but also to websites, blogs, etc.</p><p>As we all know, the average internet user won’t always have the time to visit your website or podcast channel to check new posts. <strong>So, by using RSS Feed on your website, podcast channel, email, etc., it’ll be easy for them to stay updated with every new content you publish.</strong></p><p>RSS feed is necessary for any podcaster looking to thrive in the industry, and it’s the only way to allow your target audience to access your content quickly.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144283/7443" target="_top" id="2144283">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144283" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144283/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Find-the-RSS-Feed-for-My-Podcast"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Find-the-RSS-Feed-for-My-Podcast" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How Do I Find the RSS Feed for My Podcast?"></a>Part 3. How Do I Find the RSS Feed for My Podcast?</h2><p>If you’ve uploaded podcasts to a hosting site and you’re wondering where to find the podcast RSS feed links, it’s pretty simple. You don’t need to do anything, as your RSS Feed will be automatically created once you set up your account on the platform.</p><p>Usually, the RSS feed can be found in Settings or the Directories tab. But, of course, that varies according to different hosting sites. So, we take buzzsprout as an example to show you how to get the RSS feed.</p><p>Step1 Open your podcast hosting website and navigate the Directories section. Then, locate any section tagged as Feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-2.jpg"                      alt="find rss feed from the directories tab"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on the Feed button. You should see the podcast RSS feed. You can easily copy it from there.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Create-an-RSS-Feed-for-a-Podcast"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Create-an-RSS-Feed-for-a-Podcast" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. How To Create an RSS Feed for a Podcast?"></a>Part 4. How To Create an RSS Feed for a Podcast?</h2><p>However, there is also a case that if you use a self-hosted website for podcasting, you’ll require a plugin to generate your podcast RSS feeds.

People love to create videos of themselves talking about current events, interests, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and nearly everything else under the sun. You can even build a decently sized audience with it. The only thing standing in your way is the appropriate equipment and software. Of course, all of this depends on the quality of the videos and the type of content you want. Below you will find some equipment and basic software tools that will help you to start vlogging.</p><h3 id="Equipment"><a href="#Equipment" class="headerlink" title="Equipment"></a>Equipment</h3><p>Equipment that you will need are:</p><ul><li>Camera</li><li>Tripod</li><li>Microphone</li><li>Lighting</li></ul><p>The camera is the most important bit. You cannot video blog if you cannot take any video. You will want to find a camera that you can setup and use easily. Cameras are available in most stores that sell electronics. You can purchase a large camera for higher quality production or you can go small for something basic. Consider your budget here because cameras can quickly eat up your cash.<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Check out our top 15 suggested vlogging cameras from different learning curve to different price range <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera.jpg"                      alt="vlogging camera"                ></p><p>Do not overlook the importance of a tripod. When vlogging, you cannot carry the camera around with you. If you attempt to rest it anywhere, you might not find a suitable flat surface or the camera might not rest easily on any surface. For the vlogging to work, you want a simple tripod that can hold your camera for you. This is something that will free up your hands and allow you to take a well-lit position in front of the camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-tripod.jpg"                      alt="vlogging tripod"                ></p><p>Find a microphone, as well. Some cameras will have a microphone preinstalled, but it might not have the sound quality that you are after. Keep in mind that sound quality does change depending on the microphone. A good microphone can clearly pick up your voice and create a crisp sound when you playback the recording. You can find a high-quality standalone microphone built for things like vlogging.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-microphone.jpg"                      alt="vlogging microphone"                ></p><p>Lighting is something that can drastically change the quality of a video. A video with good lighting makes you look better. The better that you look, the more interested your viewers are. If your video is dark or if there are too many shadows around, the vlog may not do as well as you would have hoped. It might come off as off-putting or it might not have the professional appearance that you were after.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-lighting.jpg"                      alt="vlogging lighting"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938745/19272" target="_top" id="1938745">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938745" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938745/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Software-Tools"><a href="#Software-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Software Tools"></a>Software Tools</h3><p>There is no need to purchase professional-level software tools for vlogging. Unless you plan to make your videos more complex, adding details and doing things beyond the basics, there is no need to pay extra. You can easily get the video quality that you are after with free software. Some software options include:</p><ul><li>iMovie</li><li>Windows Movie Maker</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p>These are only a few of the options available. All of them do a great job of helping you with the basics of vlogging. Before choosing one, remember that some are operating system specific. One built for Apple will not run on a Windows PC, just as a Windows program will not run on an Apple computer.</p><p>Upgrading is easy, too. There are plenty of programs available, such as Wondershare Filmora, that offer higher-end editing experiences at a relatively manageable price. You will not have to spend hundreds of dollars to get some of the extra features that you really want if you ever plan to upgrade.</p><p>Anyone can start vlogging right away. As long as you have the equipment and the software, you are good to go. The only thing that you want to check beforehand is the rules for your chosen upload site and the music you plan to use. Breaking rules can get you kicked out of sites so follow them. For the music, remember that you will have to pay to use some songs legally.
