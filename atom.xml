However, with so many options, it can get confusing to select one full version. At this point, you should consider the following points carefully to make your software choice.</p><p><strong>(1) Simple to use</strong></p><p>The first point to consider is how simple the software is for professional editors and total newcomers. You can access the video editing interface on some sites by clicking the “Edit” button on the imported video. Once the website has opened, click the “Subtitle” tab at the top and then hit the plus (+) button. Upload the SRT file that you just saved.</p><p>Most <strong>Sub to SRT converter online</strong> requires manual work for the conversions. Some, like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, allow automated subtitle transcription, which is easier to deal with.</p><p><strong>(2) Using experience</strong></p><p>The level of features and the variety can highly improve user experience. For example, in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, thousands of Titles and Text presets may be used for Openers, Titles, Lower Thirds, Subtitles, and Closing Credits. Plus, with the Text Editor panel, you can apply templates and add motion, text color fill, and text background. All of these features guarantee a satisfying user experience.</p><p><strong>(3) Format supported</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Video formats:</strong> AVI, MP4, MKV, WMV, MPG, MPEG, VOB, TOD, MOD, FLV, and all regular video formats.</li><li><strong>Subtitle formats:</strong> SRT, ASS, SSA</li></ul><p>While subtitles are helpful for deaf and hard-of-hearing people, there are other reasons to include captions. For example, when watching videos in public but not with earbuds, subtitles still allow them to understand what’s happening. These videos, whether for smaller clips or movies, are different in size, format, language, OS compatibility, etc.</p><p>So, when you are using a <strong>TXT to SRT converter online</strong>, see if it allows you to make multiple changes easily and if it supports varying formats without lagging or bugs.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>For audiences to comprehend your content better, videos must include subtitles. For that, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, EditingTools.io, Rev, and VEED, are some of the best options to trust with various beneficial qualities.

Multiple options are available that offer one or two types of compatibility only. On the other hand, some other software options are available that work with only one guideline preset. Here are the common distinctions.</p><table><thead><tr><th>SRT</th><th>VTT</th><th>STL</th><th>DFXP</th><th>iTT</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Filmora</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Final Cut Pro X</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>AVID Media Composer</strong></td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>Yes</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Adobe Premiere Pro</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>-</td><td>Yes</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Blackmagic DaVinci Resolve</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Vimeo</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>-</td><td>Yes</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><strong>YouTube</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Choose-the-Best-Online-SRT-converter-1"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Choose-the-Best-Online-SRT-converter-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Choose the Best Online SRT converter?"></a>Part 4: How to Choose the Best Online SRT converter?</h2><p>Now that you know what compliance matters to consider and the types of available options for <strong>mp4 to SRT converter online free,</strong> you should make your final choice. However, with so many options, it can get confusing to select one full version. At this point, you should consider the following points carefully to make your software choice.</p><p><strong>(1) Simple to use</strong></p><p>The first point to consider is how simple the software is for professional editors and total newcomers. You can access the video editing interface on some sites by clicking the “Edit” button on the imported video. Once the website has opened, click the “Subtitle” tab at the top and then hit the plus (+) button. Upload the SRT file that you just saved.</p><p>Most <strong>Sub to SRT converter online</strong> requires manual work for the conversions. Some, like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, allow automated subtitle transcription, which is easier to deal with.</p><p><strong>(2) Using experience</strong></p><p>The level of features and the variety can highly improve user experience. For example, in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, thousands of Titles and Text presets may be used for Openers, Titles, Lower Thirds, Subtitles, and Closing Credits. Plus, with the Text Editor panel, you can apply templates and add motion, text color fill, and text background. All of these features guarantee a satisfying user experience.</p><p><strong>(3) Format supported</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Video formats:</strong> AVI, MP4, MKV, WMV, MPG, MPEG, VOB, TOD, MOD, FLV, and all regular video formats.</li><li><strong>Subtitle formats:</strong> SRT, ASS, SSA</li></ul><p>While subtitles are helpful for deaf and hard-of-hearing people, there are other reasons to include captions. For example, when watching videos in public but not with earbuds, subtitles still allow them to understand what’s happening. These videos, whether for smaller clips or movies, are different in size, format, language, OS compatibility, etc.</p><p>So, when you are using a <strong>TXT to SRT converter online</strong>, see if it allows you to make multiple changes easily and if it supports varying formats without lagging or bugs.</p><h2 id="Final-Words-1"><a href="#Final-Words-1" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>For audiences to comprehend your content better, videos must include subtitles. For that, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, EditingTools.io, Rev, and VEED, are some of the best options to trust with various beneficial qualities. Of course, everyone has different preferences and needs for a subtitle converter. Go through these and choose one that suits your requirements best.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-guide-to-fine-tuning-your-google-meet-experience/"><u>2024 Approved  A Guide to Fine-Tuning Your Google Meet Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/top-actions-cameras-reviewed-hero5-vs-yi-in-the-spotlight/"><u>Top Actions Cameras Reviewed  Hero5 Vs.

Usually, the trailer consists of short clips from a movie to attract the audience to watch the whole movie. Confused about how to make a compelling trailer. No worries, today we will discuss in detail the <strong>best tips to make a fantastic movie trailer</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Best-4-tips-for-a-movie-trailer"><a href="#Part-1-Best-4-tips-for-a-movie-trailer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Best 4 tips for a movie trailer"></a>Part 1. Best 4 tips for a movie trailer</h2><p>Here are a few essential tips to make a fantastic trailer that attracts viewers to watch your full movie.</p><h3 id="1-Choose-movie-footage"><a href="#1-Choose-movie-footage" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose movie footage"></a>1. Choose movie footage</h3><p>Selecting the movie footage is the first step in editing a trailer, which truly puts the viewer’s understanding and assessment of the film to the test. You need to quickly identify the movie’s main selling features and pick the most exciting content by watching the original film. These core selling points from the movie must immediately draw the audience’s attention to the movie.</p><p><strong>In choosing material, try to pay attention to</strong>:</p><p>First of all, you should choose the content that can represent the era and the subject matter of the movie. Secondly, pick images that show the protagonist’s personality and action-packed scenes. Finally, use as many of the major dramatic lines from the movie as you can, but also pay attention to the choice of shots; they should be longer than usual.</p><p><strong>In exploring the selling point or breaking point, try to start from</strong>:</p><h5 id="1-Movie-Type"><a href="#1-Movie-Type" class="headerlink" title="1. Movie Type"></a>1. Movie Type</h5><p>Find the core highlights in the movie according to its genre, then decide whether it’s a comedy, drama, or successful IP adaptation. For instance, comedies must have humorous components, whereas dramas may have complex character dynamics, etc. The trailer below shows the top action scenes of the footage indicating the movie type.</p><h5 id="2-Images-and-Scene"><a href="#2-Images-and-Scene" class="headerlink" title="2. Images and Scene"></a>2. Images and Scene</h5><p>Cool special effects in the movie, lovely or make a big impression on viewers; dazzling or filled with new things. Shots are intended to grab the attention of the viewer.</p><h5 id="3-Protagonist"><a href="#3-Protagonist" class="headerlink" title="3. Protagonist"></a>3. Protagonist</h5><p>It would help if you also kept an eye on the main character of your movie, the social value embodied by the identity of the characters in the movie, the relationship between the characters. And whether the movie stars artists with fan appeal or box office appeal in the movie.</p><h5 id="4-Director-awards"><a href="#4-Director-awards" class="headerlink" title="4. Director awards"></a>4. Director awards</h5><p>It’s the thing you’ve seen in almost every trailer, and you know why? Because it is a crucial breaking point of the whole movie. Moreover, it’s a great way to attract the viewer’s attention. So, you should also add the Director awards while editing the trailer. Widely regarded producers and directors have a special allure and selling point based on the “golden symbol” gathered by the producer’s or director’s work. The example trailer contains the Director’s most successful works as a reference.</p><h3 id="2-Structural-Design"><a href="#2-Structural-Design" class="headerlink" title="2. Structural Design"></a>2. Structural Design</h3><p>One of the main tips is structural design. While making a trailer, it’s not the only issue to select the matter; instead, the structure should also need attention. You should think about and create a structure of frames for your trailer.</p><p>The traditional trailer typically follows a three-act structure: the first act introduces the setting and main characters. The second act introduces the most exciting parts of the movie (such as jaw-dropping special effects scenes, intense action sequences, etc.). And the third act moves the second act’s elements toward the climax (such as an intense confrontation plot or suspenseful stagnation). It’s vital to keep in mind that the climax scene from the trailer is not always the same as the movie’s climactic scene—in fact, it almost isn’t. That explains why so many movies are terrible, but the trailers edit them to look good.</p><p>A well-structured trailer is more interesting to watch than one that’s not. Look at a well-structured trailer below.</p><h3 id="3-Subtitles"><a href="#3-Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="3. Subtitles"></a>3. Subtitles</h3><p>Subtitles are a great add-on to your trailer and can help broaden your audience as they help in more precise understanding and catch audiences from all over the world, not only from your region. If you don’t know how to handle it, we recommend using the simplest white text on a black background to set the subtitles apart from the background; if you want to add some of your own personality, start with elements like fonts, strokes, and shadows. You should set the appropriate subtitle style according to the style of the film. The most common types of subtitles used in trailers are closed caption and open caption.</p><p><strong>By type of subtitles</strong>:</p><p>Closed Caption:</p><p>The closed caption is the type of subtitle that allow a viewer to turn it on or off according to the need. However, sometimes it requires decoders to use closed caption subtitles.</p><p>Open Caption:</p><p>In open captions, the subtitles always show, and the viewer can’t turn them off.</p><p><strong>By contents of subtitles</strong>:</p><p>Theme subtitles, introduce the theme of the film.</p><p>Interpreting subtitles, explain the content of the footage.</p><p>Promotional subtitles, using advertising-style words and phrases to get viewers’ attention.</p><h3 id="4-Sound-editing"><a href="#4-Sound-editing" class="headerlink" title="4. Sound editing"></a>4. Sound editing</h3><p>Sound editing also impacts the quality of the trailer. It is generally expressed in the form of background music, plus a combination of character language (dialogue, monologue, narration) and sound effects. Among these, the selection of background music is an important step in the editing process since it helps to create the mood of the movie, portray the characters’ feelings, and improve the pace of the movie. One may say that the background music selection makes up more than 70% of a successful trailer.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-make-a-movie-trailer"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-make-a-movie-trailer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

That’s pretty much how it started for every podcaster. Yet, even though it may be easy to start a podcast, it’s not always so easy to make a living at it.</p><p>We’ll show you a bunch of ways podcasters earn a living doing something they love. Let’s take a look…</p><h3 id="Sponsorship"><a href="#Sponsorship" class="headerlink" title="Sponsorship"></a>Sponsorship</h3><p>In a podcast, a sponsor is the first thing you need to think about when seeking to make money from your podcast. With so many podcast ad networks, there are many options for advertisers wanting to advertise on podcasts. Podcasters hire networks, negotiate terms, and secure content on their behalf.</p><p>You need at least 5,000 listeners per month to be accepted by Midroll or Authentic. Suppose you don’t have a minimum number of listeners, you can always connect directly with sponsors, but your niche audience must be a perfect fit to get accepted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-do-podcasters-make-2.jpg"                      alt="marketing charts"                ></p><h3 id="Complementary-products"><a href="#Complementary-products" class="headerlink" title="Complementary products"></a>Complementary products</h3><p>As a podcaster, you are your merchant.

Promoting complementary products in your podcast is the best way to make extra income.</p><p>It’s important to know the best ways to market your brand through various platforms like, selling through a third party like eBay or Etsy that allow podcasters to sell their wares at wholesale pricing.</p><p>One thing to keep in mind when selling merchandising is that the more niche your podcast is, the less likely you will be able to sell a lot of it. Instead, focus on making quality items that appeal to your target audience.</p><h3 id="Listeners’-donations"><a href="#Listeners’-donations" class="headerlink" title="Listeners’ donations"></a>Listeners’ donations</h3><p>If you don’t have any other income sources, consider crowdfunding and&#x2F;or donations to help you keep producing high-quality content.

You’ll need to carefully screen your donors, but if you’re willing to take some chances, the rewards can be pretty lucrative.</p><p>The downside is that, if you reach your fundraising goal, your funds may run out before you’re ready to launch your project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-do-podcasters-make-3.jpg"                      alt="indiegogo funds"                ></p><h3 id="Affiliate"><a href="#Affiliate" class="headerlink" title="Affiliate"></a>Affiliate</h3><p>One of the quickest ways to generate income for your podcast is to monetize it through affiliate marketing.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Conquer-Video-Quality-with-Best-3-Transcoder-Methods-for-Zoom"><a href="#Conquer-Video-Quality-with-Best-3-Transcoder-Methods-for-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Conquer Video Quality with Best 3 Transcoder Methods for Zoom"></a>Conquer Video Quality with Best 3 Transcoder Methods for Zoom</h2><p>Today, face-to-face contact is severely constrained in modern society, making the zoom for pc download quite helpful. One of its finest features is the ability to record meetings in order to capture every moment as a video. Using the Zoom app requires understanding how to convert ZOOM recordings to MP4 video format for free online. Zoom is a really practical technology that, as you undoubtedly well know, enables individuals to continue working or attending school despite the epidemic. If you have a Zoom recording, you undoubtedly have questions about how to get to the videos. Additionally, you must convert your Zoom recordings to mp4 if you detect that they are an unknown file format. However, Zoom recordings are immediately saved to your PC in MP4 format. However, sometimes the conversion is unsuccessful, leaving you with .Zoom files for your recordings. In this situation, you must convert the zoom recording to MP4.</p><p>One of its most intriguing features is the ability to record meetings in order to save every event as a film. One of the most important aspects of utilizing the Zoom app is learning how to convert a ZOOM video recording format to MP4 for free online. Zoom is a tool or software that enables several users to participate in a videoconference. It operates through meetings that attempt to replicate many of the activities we may perform at a meeting in person of any sort. Zoom allows you to record meetings, and after the meeting is over, it will begin to convert the recording to MP4. But a number of factors might lead this phase to fail. You may be wondering, “How do I convert a Zoom recording to MP4?” when you encounter the Zoom failed to convert recording problem. Thankfully, it’s a rather straightforward procedure that doesn’t need for any additional software. This article will demonstrate three different approaches for converting Zoom recordings to MP4 files. However, you must be the host of the meeting or have authorization to record it.</p><h2 id="Way-1-Convert-the-Local-Recording-in-Zoom-App"><a href="#Way-1-Convert-the-Local-Recording-in-Zoom-App" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Convert the Local Recording in Zoom App"></a>Way 1. Convert the Local Recording in Zoom App</h2><p>Zoom provides both local and cloud recording options. Users of the former may capture meeting video and audio thanks to its availability to both free and paid members. The latter allows paying subscribers to audio, video, and text-record the conference. Additionally, the recording file formats include TXT, MP4, and M4A. At the conclusion of a meeting, Zoom automatically transforms the raw video to an mp4 file. However, the video will be stored as a .zoom file if the operation is aborted. A.mp4 file that is an MP4 contains both audio and video data. M4A only has audio files in it. All MP4 files may be played using the M3U playlist file. Additionally, meeting chat conversations are saved in a TXT file.</p><h5 id="Step1Create-the-Recording"><a href="#Step1Create-the-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Step1Create the Recording"></a>Step1Create the Recording</h5><p>The recording must first be made by entering the Zoom meeting and selecting Record. Zoom gives you the option of either PC storage or cloud storage for the recordings. Both choices offer advantages and disadvantages. You should convert the files into mp4 if you want to save them on your computer since they are smaller without sacrificing quality and take up less space. You will need a Zoom account to store the files if you decide to use cloud storage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-zoom-video-converter-1.jpg"                      alt="create the recording"                ></p><h5 id="Step2Download-the-Recording"><a href="#Step2Download-the-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Step2Download the Recording"></a>Step2Download the Recording</h5><p>By accessing the Zoom folder in your computer’s Documents folder, you may quickly locate your Zoom recordings. Alternately, copy and paste the address shown here: Change “USERNAME” to the username you use for your machine in the path: Users&#x2F;USERNAME&#x2F;Documents. If you wish to arrange all of your films, the date, time, and meeting name are all included in the local Zoom folders. You may initially attempt manually converting the recording to MP4 if Zoom’s conversion of local recordings fails. Observe the directions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-zoom-video-converter-2.jpg"                      alt="download the recording"                ></p><h5 id="Step3Launch-the-Zoom-Desktop-Client-application"><a href="#Step3Launch-the-Zoom-Desktop-Client-application" class="headerlink" title="Step3Launch the Zoom Desktop Client application"></a>Step3Launch the Zoom Desktop Client application</h5><p>On your computer, launch the Zoom program. You can locate any meetings you’ve recorded in the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-zoom-video-converter-3.jpg"                      alt="launch the zoom desktop"                ></p><h5 id="Step4Go-to-Meetings"><a href="#Step4Go-to-Meetings" class="headerlink" title="Step4Go to Meetings"></a>Step4Go to Meetings</h5><p>A number of tabs are shown at the top of the window. Toggle to Meetings. There are two options, Upcoming and Recorded, on the Meetings page. You must choose Recorded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-zoom-video-converter-4.jpg"                      alt="go to meetings"                ></p><h5 id="Step5Convert-the-File-to-Mp4"><a href="#Step5Convert-the-File-to-Mp4" class="headerlink" title="Step5Convert the File to Mp4"></a>Step5Convert the File to Mp4</h5><p>The meetings you’ve recorded are shown on the left. Select the recording by clicking on it. If the recording is in .zoom format, the Convert button will be shown. The Play button will be available if not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-zoom-video-converter-5.jpg"                      alt="Cconvert the file to mp4"                ></p><h2 id="Way-2-Record-Zoom-Meeting-with-Filmora"><a href="#Way-2-Record-Zoom-Meeting-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Record Zoom Meeting with Filmora"></a>Way 2. Record Zoom Meeting with Filmora</h2><p>Zoom has a recording option, however you can only record a meeting if you are the host or have permission to do so. As a result, you are unable to record meetings anytime you want. A screen recording program from a third party, like Filmora from Wondershare, is the greatest answer to these issues. This professional program for Windows and Mac comes with a screen recording capability that enables you to record your screen activity in excellent definition, including zoom calls. Additionally, you have a variety of customizable recording options, including picture-in-picture, output format, frame rate, and quality.</p><p>The default Zoom recording is made in poor quality and offers no customizing options. Additionally, in order to record the meeting as a participant, you must have the host’s consent. MP4 is the ideal file type for saving Zoom meetings. This is due to the great compatibility of the MP4 format with a variety of hardware and media players. The MP4 format also provides high quality while being somewhat modest in size. Use Wondershare Filmora to get over these problems and capture Zoom meetings in excellent definition. The captured video may be transferred, compressed, and given further editing as required with this program.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><strong>Steps to Record Zoom and Export the Video as Mp4 Format</strong></p><h5 id="Step1Download-and-Install-Filmora"><a href="#Step1Download-and-Install-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step1Download and Install Filmora"></a>Step1Download and Install Filmora</h5><p>In the first step, visit the official website to download the latest version of Filmora for your PC. Afterwards, launch the installer to initiate the installation process. Upon completion, you’ll be directed to the Filmora launcher as shown below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-zoom-video-converter-6.jpg"                      alt="download and install filmora"                ></p><h5 id="Step2Customize-Zoom-Screen"><a href="#Step2Customize-Zoom-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Step2Customize Zoom Screen"></a>Step2Customize Zoom Screen</h5><p>Now, go for the screen recorder option and on the other hand, visit the Zoom meeting which you want to record with Filmora in Mp4. Simply, launch the Meeting and subsequently, configure the recording interface within the Filmora recorder as shown below. You can select Mp4 as file format of the recording here as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-zoom-video-converter-7.jpg"                      alt="customize zoom screen"                ></p><h5 id="Step3Start-Recording"><a href="#Step3Start-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Step3Start Recording"></a>Step3Start Recording</h5><p>Click the Recording button after the customization choices have been decided upon, and the recording will start after a 3-second countdown. You may further customize the recording while it is in progress by using the top bar to take screenshots, muffle the voice, and add unique shapes and lines.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-zoom-video-converter-8.jpg"                      alt="start recording"                ></p><h5 id="Step4Put-Recording-to-End"><a href="#Step4Put-Recording-to-End" class="headerlink" title="Step4Put Recording to End"></a>Step4Put Recording to End</h5><p>Click the red Stop button after the zoom call is over or you want to end the recording. The recording will be processed by the program, and it will then show up on the user interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-zoom-video-converter-9.jpg"                      alt="put recording to end"                ></p><h5 id="Step5Edit-and-Convert-the-Video-in-Mp4-Format"><a href="#Step5Edit-and-Convert-the-Video-in-Mp4-Format" class="headerlink" title="Step5Edit and Convert the Video in Mp4 Format"></a>Step5Edit and Convert the Video in Mp4 Format</h5><p>From the chosen folder on the system, you can discover the recorded video. Using the corresponding tabs on the interface, the recorded video may be further altered, converted, transferred, and compressed. Using the program, you may even alter the zoom pre-recorded movie.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-zoom-video-converter-10.jpg"                      alt="edit and convert the video"                ></p><p>You can also share the recording upon the successful Mp4 conversion of Zoom meetings. Simply refer to the Export window and choose the best setting to share your Zoom recordings on the go.</p><h2 id="Way-3-Use-zTscoder-exe"><a href="#Way-3-Use-zTscoder-exe" class="headerlink" title="Way 3. Use zTscoder.exe"></a>Way 3. Use zTscoder.exe</h2><p>You must first install the program before you can use zTscoder. Either the Windows installer or a download from the website may be used to install the program. By then, a recorded Zoom conference may be saved. Depending on the Zoom version you are using, there are really two methods to store your recordings. You can only store your recordings locally on your disk if you use Zoom’s free version. You may store your recordings both locally and to the Zoom cloud if you have a premium subscription, however. If the previous techniques didn’t work for you or you can’t locate your required meeting in the Recorded tab (this occurs when your meeting was recorded from a web browser), you might try the way below:</p><h5 id="Step1Run-the-zTscoder-Launcher"><a href="#Step1Run-the-zTscoder-Launcher" class="headerlink" title="Step1Run the zTscoder Launcher"></a>Step1Run the zTscoder Launcher</h5><p>Click System and Security &gt; System in the Control Panel after opening it. Select the Advanced system settings option. Select Environment Variables from the Advanced menu. Click Edit after selecting the Path variable under System variables. Then, add the following path to the Variable value box: Add C:\Users\username*\AppData\Roaming\Zoom\bin and then click OK.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-zoom-video-converter-11.jpg"                      alt="run the ztscoder launcher"                ></p><h5 id="Step2Select-the-Video"><a href="#Step2Select-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step2Select the Video"></a>Step2Select the Video</h5><p>Navigate to the folder where Zoom stores its recordings, right-click on the file, and choose “Open with…” Scroll down to the Look for another app on this PC section for more applications.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-zoom-video-converter-12.jpg"                      alt="select the video"                ></p><h5 id="Step3Launch-the-Conversion"><a href="#Step3Launch-the-Conversion" class="headerlink" title="Step3Launch the Conversion"></a>Step3Launch the Conversion</h5><p>Click the Open button after selecting zTscoder.exe and going to the location: C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\Zoom\bin</p><p>Then, select zTscoder.exe, and click the Open.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-zoom-video-converter-13.jpg"                      alt="launch the conversion"                ></p><h5 id="Step4Preview-the-Converted-File"><a href="#Step4Preview-the-Converted-File" class="headerlink" title="Step4Preview the Converted File"></a>Step4Preview the Converted File</h5><p>At that point, an automated conversion of the Zoom recording to MP4 will begin. You’ll then see an MP4 video file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-zoom-video-converter-14.jpg"                      alt="preview the converted file"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Zoom recording not converting errors may be fixed by checking the disk capacity and, if required, making some space available. Additionally, the problem will persist if you shut down the computer while converting the recording or rename the .zoom file. If the conversion of your Zoom recording to MP4 is unsuccessful, try the two methods mentioned above. How can the Zoom recording not converting problem be fixed? To convert a Zoom recording to MP4, use the steps listed above.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Comparing-Augmented-Reality-Stickers-Beyond-Google"><a href="#Comparing-Augmented-Reality-Stickers-Beyond-Google" class="headerlink" title="Comparing Augmented Reality Stickers: Beyond Google"></a>Comparing Augmented Reality Stickers: Beyond Google</h2><p>Did you know that Google Pixel phones have a feature called <strong>Google AR Stickers</strong>? AR Stands for augmented reality - a technology that combines the real world and digital content. You can use it to make fun images and videos. But how do you use this feature? And are there options for people without a Google Pixel phone?</p><p>In this article, we will take a look at this feature. Also, we will show you a great alternative that lets you experience the same but using other devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-ar-stickers-its-alternative.gif"                      alt="google ar stickers and its alternative"                ></p><h2 id="What-Is-Google-AR-Sticker"><a href="#What-Is-Google-AR-Sticker" class="headerlink" title="What Is Google AR Sticker?"></a>What Is Google AR Sticker?</h2><p>Think of stickers that you can put on images or videos. However, these stickers are in 3D. Furthermore, they look like they are actually in the environment or they are a part of your body. However, you can only see them through a camera lens.</p><p>You can look at Pokemon Go to understand it better. The game allows you to “place” your Pokemon in the real world and take photos of them. Google AR stickers are like that, except the stickers are not strictly only Pokemon. There are letters, food, Stranger Things characters, and more!</p><h2 id="History-of-Google-AR-Sticker"><a href="#History-of-Google-AR-Sticker" class="headerlink" title="History of Google AR Sticker"></a>History of Google AR Sticker</h2><p>Back in 2017, virtual reality and augmented reality received an increase in interest. While these technologies weren’t really new, it was at this time that they became common. Apps like Snapchat included AR stickers that allowed users to take photos and videos with their favorite fictional characters and such. Google hopped on the trend by incorporating AR stickers into its smartphone, Pixel 2.</p><p>The thing is that it did not last long. Ever since Google launched its Pixel 4a in 2020, they no longer provided AR stickers. The camera of the new devices is not compatible with AR stickers, Playground, and Playmoji. And that’s the end of Google AR Stickers.</p><p>Owners of older Pixel models should not worry since the devices’ hardware isn’t changed. Thus, they will continue to support Playground, the app needed to use Google AR Stickers.</p><h2 id="How-To-Use-Google-Playground-AR-Stickers-on-Pixel-4-and-Earlier"><a href="#How-To-Use-Google-Playground-AR-Stickers-on-Pixel-4-and-Earlier" class="headerlink" title="How To Use Google Playground AR Stickers on Pixel 4 and Earlier"></a>How To Use Google Playground AR Stickers on Pixel 4 and Earlier</h2><p>As mentioned above, older Pixel models still have Google Playground support. These devices are Pixel 4 and earlier. Meanwhile, Playmojis (3D AR Stickers) are available only for Pixel 3, 3a, and 4.</p><p>Here’s a step-by-step tutorial on how to use this feature:</p><p>Step1 Ensure you have Android 8.1 (Oreo) installed on your Pixel. Also, ensure the Google Camera app is updated.</p><p>Step2 Launch the Google Camera app.</p><p>Step3 Tap **”**More” &gt; “Playground.”</p><p>Step4 Select “Stickers” &gt; “Playmoji” or “Stickers.”</p><p>Step5 Tap the AR Sticker or Playmoji that you want to use.</p><p>Step6 Touch and hold, and drag the AR sticker where you want it to be on the photo or video. Adjust the sticker as needed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-ar-stickers-6.jpg"                      alt="dragging star wars sticker to camera screen"                ></p><p>Step7 Tap “Capture” to take a photo.

It’s understandable since “augmented reality” sounds very advanced and complex. Here are some FAQs about it to make you more informed about the subject.</p><p><strong>Q1. What Are AR Stickers?</strong></p><p>AR stickers are augmented reality image effects you can add to improve photos or videos. They can be static images or animations. Some examples are eyeglasses, bunny headbands, hats, beards, or even animals or characters.</p><p>The application that offers it maps your face or the environment in the video and tracks movements. With that, they make it seem like the AR sticker is real instead of a virtual object.</p><p>Let’s suppose you added AR eyeglasses to the video you are recording. When you move, the eyeglasses will follow your eyes instead of staying where they originally were.</p><p><strong>Q2. Can You Use AR Without an App?</strong></p><p>Perhaps you don’t want to install custom AR apps. That’s not new. According to some studies, engagement drops by 50% when users need to download. So, some developers chose the WebAR path instead.</p><p>WebAR uses web technologies to let users experience augmented reality. All you need is a phone or any device with a camera and a web browser. Since most modern browsers and operating systems already support AR, WebAR makes the experience so accessible.</p><p><strong>Q3. Are AR Apps Safe?</strong></p><p>AR Apps can be dangerous, but not all of them are. Keep in mind that AR apps can see what you are doing in real-time. If that information falls into the wrong hands, you may end up in trouble.</p><p>Vendors can also add malware or other things to the apps. So it’s necessary that you always stay vigilant. As much as possible, download AR apps from vendors with a good reputation.

While Microsoft Word’s text-to-speech technology used to be prone to errors that needed correcting later, it has advanced considerably in recent years and is now among the best in the business.</p><p>Whether you have the best Windows laptop or Mac—Microsoft Word’s speech-to-text is simple to discover and use. You’ll find all you need to know about connecting your microphone and inserting punctuation in this manual, from the first steps to the more complex aspects.</p><p>Here’s how to use Microsoft Word’s speech-to-text feature:</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Top Recommendation: Wondershare Filmora</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Evernote Speech-To-Text</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Google Docs Speech-To-Text</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">FAQs</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Use-Speech-to-Text-in-Microsoft-Word"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Use-Speech-to-Text-in-Microsoft-Word" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Use Speech to Text in Microsoft Word?"></a>Part 1: How to Use Speech to Text in Microsoft Word?</h2><p>Before you can use Speech to Text in Microsoft Word, the first thing you need is a valid Microsoft 365 subscription. Without a Microsoft 365 subscription, Microsoft won’t allow you to use voice typing. However, if you’re working for a company, it’s likely that your company already has a Microsoft 365 enterprise subscription. If you’re a student or your company doesn’t offer it, the subscription plans are pretty affordable. For example, Microsoft 365 Personal and Microsoft 365 Family plans cost $6.99&#x2F;month and $9.99&#x2F;month, respectively.</p><p>The second thing you need is a dependable internet connection. The reason is Microsoft Word’s dictation software works on remote servers to interpret your words. These enormous servers and lightning-fast processors require a large amount of speech data to transcribe your text. In reality, the program uses sophisticated neural networks and deep machine learning technology to ensure that it understands the nuances of human speech. These two technologies have helped voice typing technology evolve rapidly in recent years, which is why an internet connection is necessary.</p><p>Now let’s start typing:</p><h5 id="Step1Open-Microsoft-Word"><a href="#Step1Open-Microsoft-Word" class="headerlink" title="Step1Open Microsoft Word"></a>Step1Open Microsoft Word</h5><p>Create a new, empty document in Microsoft Word on your device. Name your document and save it on the desktop or wherever you like it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-1.jpg"                      alt="open microsoft word"                ></p><h5 id="Step2Click-on-the-Dictate-button"><a href="#Step2Click-on-the-Dictate-button" class="headerlink" title="Step2Click on the Dictate button"></a>Step2Click on the Dictate button</h5><p>When you first open a new document, go to the top right corner of the Home menu includes a Dictate button and a drop-down menu. It has a microphone symbol above it. Double-check that the language is set to English using the drop-down menu. Choose English or any of the supported languages.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-2.jpg"                      alt="click on the dictate button"                ></p><p>Microsoft Word Speech to Text tool supports many languages as well languages that have multiple variants, such as English and French. In addition, you can type on Microsoft Word in Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Taiwanese), English, French (France, Canada), German, Hindi, Italian, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil, Portugal), Russian, Spanish (Mexico, Spain), Thai, and more.</p><h5 id="Step3Allow-Microsoft-Word-Access-to-the-Microphone"><a href="#Step3Allow-Microsoft-Word-Access-to-the-Microphone" class="headerlink" title="Step3Allow Microsoft Word Access to the Microphone"></a>Step3Allow Microsoft Word Access to the Microphone</h5><p>If you’ve never used Microsoft Word’s speech-to-text engine on Windows PC before, you’ll need to allow the program access to your microphone. This may be completed with a single click when prompted. You can use your laptop’s built-in microphone or connect an external one. But, we suggest you use an external microphone for improved accuracy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-3.jpg"                      alt="allow microsoft word access to the microphone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-4.jpg"                      alt="use speech to text"                ></p><p>Follow these steps to activate the microphone in Mac.</p><p>To turn voice dictation on or off:</p><ul><li>Select Apple &gt; System Preferences</li><li>Select View &gt; Dictation &amp; Speech</li><li>Click ON to enable Dictation or OFF to disable it</li></ul><h5 id="Step4Start-Dictating-Your-Document"><a href="#Step4Start-Dictating-Your-Document" class="headerlink" title="Step4Start Dictating Your Document"></a>Step4Start Dictating Your Document</h5><p>Once again, click the dictate button after completing all the preceding steps. The blue symbol will vanish, and a red recording symbol will appear, signifying that Microsoft Word has begun listening for your voice. A chime will sound if your sound is turned up, indicating that transcription has started. Say the words you want Microsoft to transcribe out loud. It may seem odd at first, but after a while, you’ll get a flow going, and everyone will find their own method for getting the most out of the program. To stop the recording, click on the microphone button again or press “Ctrl + Shift + S” on your keyboard. This will show the Stop Dictation dialogue box. From here, you can either save or cancel your work.</p><h5 id="Step5Using-Punctuation-Commands"><a href="#Step5Using-Punctuation-Commands" class="headerlink" title="Step5Using Punctuation Commands"></a>Step5Using Punctuation Commands</h5><p>Microsoft Word’s text-to-speech technology does more than simply transcribing your voice. Instead, Microsoft’s voice typing technology, which originally listened only to single words, now listens to individual words and the phrase as a whole, thanks to the advent and improvement of artificial neural networks. This has allowed Microsoft to develop a long list of commands for incorporating punctuation, symbols, and other formatting options into your text without saying anything out loud except for the command word itself. To see the list of commands, press “Ctrl + Shift + S” on your keyboard to open the Stop Dictation dialogue box, then click on the Commands button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-5.jpg"                      alt="using punctuation commands"                ></p><p>We can’t go through all of the punctuation instructions here, but we’ll mention a few of the most important. For example, the command “period” inserts a period, and “comma” creates a comma, as you may guess. The same rules apply to exclamation marks and colons. In addition, you may use the command “new line” to create a new line, “new paragraph” to start a new paragraph, and “tab” to create a tab space.</p><p>If you want to insert symbols, the commands are a bit different. For example, saying “open parenthesis” will automatically insert an opening parenthesis, but you’ll need to say “close parenthesis” to get a closing parenthesis. The same goes for brackets, braces, and quotation marks.</p><p>Microsoft’s speech-to-text program is excellent.

Without a Microsoft 365 subscription, Microsoft won’t allow you to use voice typing. However, if you’re working for a company, it’s likely that your company already has a Microsoft 365 enterprise subscription. If you’re a student or your company doesn’t offer it, the subscription plans are pretty affordable. For example, Microsoft 365 Personal and Microsoft 365 Family plans cost $6.99&#x2F;month and $9.99&#x2F;month, respectively.</p><p>The second thing you need is a dependable internet connection. The reason is Microsoft Word’s dictation software works on remote servers to interpret your words. These enormous servers and lightning-fast processors require a large amount of speech data to transcribe your text. In reality, the program uses sophisticated neural networks and deep machine learning technology to ensure that it understands the nuances of human speech. These two technologies have helped voice typing technology evolve rapidly in recent years, which is why an internet connection is necessary.</p><p>Now let’s start typing:</p><h5 id="Step1Open-Microsoft-Word-1"><a href="#Step1Open-Microsoft-Word-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1Open Microsoft Word"></a>Step1Open Microsoft Word</h5><p>Create a new, empty document in Microsoft Word on your device.

It has a microphone symbol above it. Double-check that the language is set to English using the drop-down menu. Choose English or any of the supported languages.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-2.jpg"                      alt="click on the dictate button"                ></p><p>Microsoft Word Speech to Text tool supports many languages as well languages that have multiple variants, such as English and French. In addition, you can type on Microsoft Word in Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Taiwanese), English, French (France, Canada), German, Hindi, Italian, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil, Portugal), Russian, Spanish (Mexico, Spain), Thai, and more.</p><h5 id="Step3Allow-Microsoft-Word-Access-to-the-Microphone-1"><a href="#Step3Allow-Microsoft-Word-Access-to-the-Microphone-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3Allow Microsoft Word Access to the Microphone"></a>Step3Allow Microsoft Word Access to the Microphone</h5><p>If you’ve never used Microsoft Word’s speech-to-text engine on Windows PC before, you’ll need to allow the program access to your microphone. This may be completed with a single click when prompted. You can use your laptop’s built-in microphone or connect an external one. But, we suggest you use an external microphone for improved accuracy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-3.jpg"                      alt="allow microsoft word access to the microphone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-4.jpg"                      alt="use speech to text"                ></p><p>Follow these steps to activate the microphone in Mac.</p><p>To turn voice dictation on or off:</p><ul><li>Select Apple &gt; System Preferences</li><li>Select View &gt; Dictation &amp; Speech</li><li>Click ON to enable Dictation or OFF to disable it</li></ul><h5 id="Step4Start-Dictating-Your-Document-1"><a href="#Step4Start-Dictating-Your-Document-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4Start Dictating Your Document"></a>Step4Start Dictating Your Document</h5><p>Once again, click the dictate button after completing all the preceding steps. The blue symbol will vanish, and a red recording symbol will appear, signifying that Microsoft Word has begun listening for your voice. A chime will sound if your sound is turned up, indicating that transcription has started. Say the words you want Microsoft to transcribe out loud. It may seem odd at first, but after a while, you’ll get a flow going, and everyone will find their own method for getting the most out of the program. To stop the recording, click on the microphone button again or press “Ctrl + Shift + S” on your keyboard. This will show the Stop Dictation dialogue box. From here, you can either save or cancel your work.</p><h5 id="Step5Using-Punctuation-Commands-1"><a href="#Step5Using-Punctuation-Commands-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5Using Punctuation Commands"></a>Step5Using Punctuation Commands</h5><p>Microsoft Word’s text-to-speech technology does more than simply transcribing your voice. Instead, Microsoft’s voice typing technology, which originally listened only to single words, now listens to individual words and the phrase as a whole, thanks to the advent and improvement of artificial neural networks. This has allowed Microsoft to develop a long list of commands for incorporating punctuation, symbols, and other formatting options into your text without saying anything out loud except for the command word itself. To see the list of commands, press “Ctrl + Shift + S” on your keyboard to open the Stop Dictation dialogue box, then click on the Commands button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-5.jpg"                      alt="using punctuation commands"                ></p><p>We can’t go through all of the punctuation instructions here, but we’ll mention a few of the most important. For example, the command “period” inserts a period, and “comma” creates a comma, as you may guess. The same rules apply to exclamation marks and colons. In addition, you may use the command “new line” to create a new line, “new paragraph” to start a new paragraph, and “tab” to create a tab space.</p><p>If you want to insert symbols, the commands are a bit different. For example, saying “open parenthesis” will automatically insert an opening parenthesis, but you’ll need to say “close parenthesis” to get a closing parenthesis. The same goes for brackets, braces, and quotation marks.</p><p>Microsoft’s speech-to-text program is excellent. We can honestly state that Microsoft has the most refined product when it comes to cost vs performance because the software is integrated directly into Microsoft 365, which many businesses already use.

Final Cut Pro is one of the most popular paid video editors that professional video creators recommend. Final Cut Pro is a paid software and you have to pay a hefty one-time fee for lifetime full access. Therefore, it is important that you know everything about Final Cut Pro before purchasing it.</p><p>We have done a complete review of Apple Final Cut Pro. We have stated the key features, pricing details as well as overall performance. Along with these parameters, we have highlighted the pros and cons of Final Cut Pro. Thereafter, you can check out our tutorial on how to edit a video on Final Cut Pro. Finally, we have provided a better alternative to Final Cut Pro if you are not satisfied with FCP.</p><h2 id="1-History-of-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#1-History-of-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1. History of Final Cut Pro"></a>1. History of Final Cut Pro</h2><p>The journey of Final Cut Pro(FCP) began as an alternative to Adobe Premiere Pro. FCP was initially developed by Macromedia. The designer of FCP named Randy Ubillos used to work for Adobe Premiere previously. In 1998, Apple purchased the development team of Final Cut Pro. Hence, Macromedia FCP turned into Apple FCP.</p><p>The popularity of Final Cut Pro started to pick up in the early 2000s. A popular movie producer named Michael Bloom praised FCP to boost its popularity. The software did not crash even once during rendering a movie. Soon, the popular director Roger Avery became the spokesperson for Apple FCP. This encouraged video creators and producers to try out Final Cut Pro as a video editor.</p><p>The breakthrough came in 2002 when Final Cut Pro was awarded a Primetime Emmy Engineering Award. Final Cut Express was launched in 2003 at an affordable rate. But it was discontinued in 2011. This is because Apple launched Final Cut Pro X in April 2011.</p><p>Final Cut Pro X came with a new user interface and workflow. It was packed with loads of new features. Subsequently, new features such as effects, filters, color enhancement, and support for HDR and 360-degree video were introduced. This helped it to become one of the best video editors in the world.</p><h2 id="2-Features-of-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#2-Features-of-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="2. Features of Final Cut Pro"></a>2. Features of Final Cut Pro</h2><p>Final Cut Pro is a feature-rich video editor. Starting from basic features for regular video editing to advanced tools for professional video editing, you get everything in one software. Here are the key features of Final Cut Pro by Apple that you should know.</p><p>Video Cut: You have to deal with multiple video clips for one video project. Naturally, you have to cut and trim video clips and edit them before joining them. Final Cut Pro comes with a state-of-the-art set of trimming tools. Starting from ripple edit and roll edit to slide and slip edit, you can use these techniques comfortably.</p><p><strong>Title and Caption:</strong> Texts are an important part of every video. There is no doubt that a great text effect and a stunning text animation take video to the next level. Final Cut Pro has loads of text effects and presets that you can apply to enhance titles and captions. Starting from opening and ending crediting to lower-thirds and subtitles, there are presets for everything.</p><p><strong>Transitions</strong>: Transitions are an integral part of video editing. Whenever there is a change of scenes, there has to be a transition effect. A transition prevents jump cuts and awkward scene shifting. Final Cut Pro has a wide range of transitions that will enhance your video content.</p><p><strong>Video Effects</strong>: There are over 300 video effects in Final Cut Pro. The more the video effects, the more popular the video editor becomes. But there is no point in having loads of video effects unless they can impactful. Final Cut Pro stands out for its video effects and animations and you can customize them as per your requirements.</p><p><strong>Chroma Key</strong>: You see the use of green screen background in movies and films. Final Cut Pro supports the Chroma key by which you can remove the green screen background. You can replace it with anything starting from static background to dynamic background. Besides, you can add effects and animations to make it dramatic and cinematic.</p><p><strong>Audio Editing</strong>: Last but not least, the audio part of a video is extremely important. Starting from dialogs to background music, everything enhances the video content. Final Cut Pro has a dedicated audio editor where you can edit audio clips as good as video clips. You can also separate sound clips into different audio lanes.</p><h2 id="3-Price-Choices-of-FCP"><a href="#3-Price-Choices-of-FCP" class="headerlink" title="3. Price Choices of FCP"></a>3. Price Choices of FCP</h2><p>Most premium video editors charge monthly, quarterly, or annual subscription fees. But Final Cut Pro does not have any subscription-based pricing model. It charges a one-time fee for lifetime full access. The one-time fee is $299.99 and there are no additional charges for future updates.</p><p>The one-time fee may seem massive but if you use FCP for a few years, it will become rather economical. For a professional video editor who prefers FCP over others, the one-time fee is the most economical price model. You can try out its free trial version for 90 days to understand if FCP is meant for you.</p><h2 id="4-Performance"><a href="#4-Performance" class="headerlink" title="4. Performance"></a>4.

It takes the least amount of time for rendering among all premium video editors. Thanks to its magnetic timeline and enhanced workflow, video editing has become easy.</p><p>There are loads of features and tools available for advanced video editing. You can edit 4K, 8K 360-videos, HDR, and VR videos without crashing. Object tracking, color grading, and cinematic mode are quite unique and highly useful.

The Rift had it’s unveiling on 28th March 2016. Its price is currently $599 and comes with an Xbox controller.</p><p>The requirements for The Rift are:</p><ul><li>NVIDIA GTX 970 equivalent or greater</li><li>AMD 290 equivalent or greater</li><li>Intel i5-4590 equivalent or greater</li><li>8GB+ DDR3 RAM</li><li>HDMI 1.3 video output</li><li>2 USB 3.0 ports</li></ul><p>Accessories:</p><ul><li>Remote</li><li>Xbox One Controller</li></ul><p>Specs:</p><ul><li>1080 × 1200 per eye and two screen resolution 2160 × 1200 pixels</li><li>100-110 degree field of view</li><li>3D Audio</li><li>Gyroscope Magnetometer Tracking Sensor Array</li><li>Weight 470 g (1.03 lbs.)</li><li>USB, HDMI</li></ul><p>The Rift allows players to feel virtual reality from the ease of a chair. Oculus Touch controllers will ultimately take VR to another dimension. The Rift is enclosed in a black fabric that gives off a premium feel and gives it a distinction from other VR Headsets. It is lightweight and its straps are designed so that they adjust easily. All the cords are boarded on one side. For glasses-wearers, this is going to be a difficult fit and will take some tricks before it fits.</p><p>Rift’s screen resolution is 2160 x 1200 and OLED display has been used, these are a lot of pixels per eye; this means you’ll be getting a ultra-quality view to the eyes with a 90 Hz refresh rate.</p><p>The Rift has to render objects in the stereotypical way, which means it has to keep track of the pictures, the head movements and head’s positions at various times in the physical space.</p><p>Oculus Rift has the most solid lineup of games putting it on the advantage. It has access to both Steam VR and Oculus Store giving the users a surplus amount of games already.</p><p>Although the Rift demands a hardcore gaming desktop, its price is still at a medium range. It also gives the ability to perform in a small room which is an excellent feature. But the drawback is that it only works on head movement and it has some heat up problems. There are no motion controllers at the moment.</p><h3 id="PlayStation-VR"><a href="#PlayStation-VR" class="headerlink" title="PlayStation VR"></a>PlayStation VR</h3><p>The PlayStation VR is yet to be revealed but its unveiled price shows that it is the best priced VR Headset i.e. $399 excluding a $60 PS Camera which is a requirement. The PS VR will be launching on 13th October 2016.</p><p>As far as the requirements are concerned, this VR Headset only requires a Sony PlayStation 4.</p><p>Accessories:</p><ul><li>PS Move</li><li>DualShock</li></ul><p>Specs:</p><ul><li>1920 × 1080 single screen, 960 × 1080 per eye</li><li>100 degree field of view</li><li>120 Hz refresh Rate</li><li>3D Audio</li><li>Gyroscope Magnetometer, PS Eye Tracking, Accelerometer</li><li>Weight 610 g (1.34 lbs.)</li></ul><p>Sony has taken a completely diverse approach to the design of its headset. It resembles a Sci-Fi kind of technology like that in Star Trek. It has a helmet like portion above its goggles with can be adjusted to fit on different sized heads. This means that you won’t feel you’re wearing some funny goggles; instead, you get the feel of a super-cool helmet. The weight is balanced such that your eyes and nose do not feel the entire weight of the thing.</p><p>PlayStation VR consists of a 1920 x 1080 display (5.7-inch). An OLED display split delivers a resolution of 960 x 1080 the user’s respective eyes vertically. Sony was found to underperform in picture sharpness but this headset has got its advantage in the stunning 120 Hz refresh rate, which takes it to the top in this matter.</p><p>The tracking mechanism is similar to that of Rift’s but PS VR has got its advantage because of its powerful AMD processor and a lot of sensors which track every movement and put the amazing feeling in the virtual reality with matchless synchronization.</p><p>The drawback of PlayStation VR is that it is only designed for PS4. Good news is, each and every game of PS4 is supported. But this puts The Rift one step ahead.</p><p>In terms of price, conform, sensors and their amazing VR effect and its extreme refresh rate, this VR Headset comes on top; what lags it behind is its heavy duty weight, low resolution and its inability to perform with PCs.</p><h3 id="HTC-Vive"><a href="#HTC-Vive" class="headerlink" title="HTC Vive"></a>HTC Vive</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Vive VR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the priciest VR Headset; $799. It was released on 5th April 2016.</p><p>System Requirements:</p><ul><li>NVIDIA GTX 970 equivalent or greater</li><li>AMD 290 equivalent or greater</li><li>Intel i5-4590 equivalent or greater</li><li>AMD FZ 8350 equivalent or greater</li><li>8GB+ DDR3 RAM</li><li>HDMI 1.4 video output</li><li>1 USB 2.0 port or greater</li></ul><p>Accessories:</p><ul><li>2 wireless controllers</li></ul><p>Specs:</p><ul><li>1080 × 1200 per eye; two screen resolution of 2160 × 1200</li><li>110 degree field of view</li><li>90Hz refresh rate</li><li>Front facing Gyroscope Camera, laser sensor</li><li>Weight 555 g (1.22 lbs.)</li></ul><p>As far as design is concerned, you will not look cool wearing these huge amusing goggles on your face. The Vive gives a dimpled look and has an elastic to support it on your head. Very discomforting indeed. But it comes with a perk, that is, HTC added an external camera on the front so that the user is able to look on the other side.</p><p>Vive VR and the Rift have the same resolution, giving a 1080 x 1200 image for each eye that combines to become a 2160 x 1200 resolution. Both have a refresh rate of 90 Hz and a 110-degree field of view. This puts the Rift ahead since it’s much cheaper.</p><p>In terms of games, the Vive VR kind of ties with Sony since HTC has not provided many games from other platforms; only PC games can be played.</p><p>The reason for such a costly hardware is the superior Incomparable VR experience, room-scale tracking, and intuitive interface.</p><h3 id="Comparison-of-these-three-VR-headsets"><a

href="#Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Verdict"></a>Verdict</h2><p>The HTC Vive is very costly yet it does not provide sufficient features with such a great price. Hence the Vive has been lagging behind and discussed less in websites. However, the competition is more challenging between Sony and The Rift; Sony gives superior feel and comfort as well as an unmatched tracking and refresh rate. But the Rift has a bigger hand in image quality and weight.

So, suppose the podcast file you try to upload is greyed out. Then, chances are GarageBand does not support its codec.</p><p><strong>Here are the fixes we recommend for this error</strong></p><p>To fix this error, you have to change the file from .mp3 to .wav. If you’re using your iPhone, you can use a file converter app to operate. But if you’re on a macOS, you need to locate the podcast MP3 file, right-click on it, then rename it to be in .wav format.</p><p>This <a class="link"   href="https://youtu.be/CeuA1shy1u4" >YouTube video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> should walk you through the process better.</p><h3 id="Error-3-The-save-file-operation-failed"><a href="#Error-3-The-save-file-operation-failed" class="headerlink" title="Error 3: The save file operation failed"></a>Error 3: The save file operation failed</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-podcasts-in-garageband-11.jpg"                      alt="the save file operation failed"                ></p><p>Another error is the inability to save the file.

Whether you are an adventure sport enthusiast looking to immortalize every moment during high speed jumping, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >diving <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, skiing experience, or looking forward to produce documentary-style motion videos, the action camera is the most precious possession.</p><p> GoPro has been dominating the market for over a decade, now due to its popularity among professionals, availability of compatible <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >accessories <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and above all its quality.

Ideally, it can be hard to find a GoPro under $100. Even a basic model is priced at $130. While preparing a budget, you must also consider a checklist of supportive accessories and their prices.</p><p><strong>Supportive Accessories:</strong> Though the manufacturers provide some basic gears such as waterproof housing with the camera, it is always necessary to purchase the most compatible high quality accessories that fit your camera best. Some basic requirements include mounts, tripods, filters, extended life batteries etc.</p><p><strong>Camera Specifications and Features:</strong> At the end of the day, your picture or video quality is the main thing that matters. Decide what quality picture resolution or video shooting do you intend to achieve. Consider choosing highest pixel for photos and 4k resolution for best results with final edited video.</p><p><strong>Weather Resistance Protection:</strong> Your action camera is exposed to moisture and fluctuating temperatures often. Your camera should have a waterproof housing or water resistant protection support to ensure greater durability.</p><p><strong>Camera Shape, Dimension and Weight:</strong> The action camera is mostly mounted on the photographer’s body during high-speed mobility. Choose a camera with extremely compact design (preferably box shaped) and lightweight model for convenient mounting.</p><h2 id="Top-6-Cheapest-Action-Cameras-to-Buy-Under-100-1"><a href="#Top-6-Cheapest-Action-Cameras-to-Buy-Under-100-1" class="headerlink" title="Top 6 Cheapest Action Cameras to Buy Under $100"></a>Top 6 Cheapest Action Cameras to Buy Under $100</h2><h4 id="1-Polaroid-Cube"><a href="#1-Polaroid-Cube" class="headerlink" title="**1.
