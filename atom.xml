With 32GB of RAM memory, the Nvidia GTX 1080 graphics card and a17-inch 4K monitor gamers will never have to worry about anything else but the gameplay.

Their Asus Rog G701VI- XS78K is a powerful machine that can support even the most demanding gaming needs. The Asus’ 17.3-inch model features the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 8GB graphics card, accompanied by a 64GB 2,400Hz DDR4 RAM memory. The processor is a quad-core 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-6820HK that can operate at 3.2GHz in the Extreme mode. Furthermore, the laptop’s state of the art G-Sync IPS 1920X1080 screen has a 120Hz refresh rate and delivers the pixel perfect images that will win the hearts of any hard-core gaming fan. Despite the amazing specifications, some experts argue that the Asus Rog G701V1-XS78K could offer more for its current market value.</p><h4 id="3-MSI-GT83VR-TITAN"><a href="#3-MSI-GT83VR-TITAN" class="headerlink" title="3.

The 18.4-inch 1920X1080 Worldview IPS display provides stunning images despite the fact that it doesn’t offer a true 4K resolution. Two Nvidia GeForce GTX graphics cards each have an 8GB of GDDR5X VRAM and they are supported by the 3.1 GHz Intel Core i7-7920HQ quad-core processor and a decent 64 GB of DDR4 RAM.</p><p>MSI’s Titan series model also has a capability to handle VR applications which can be useful to gamers who want to play VR-based games. Although some gamers might find this laptop a bit pricey and a bit bulky, there is no doubt that the GT83VR is one of the best gaming notebooks of 2017.</p><h4 id="4-SI-GT73VR-TITAN-4K-480"><a href="#4-SI-GT73VR-TITAN-4K-480" class="headerlink" title="4.

The first and perhaps the largest difference is the GT73VR’s 17.3-inch 3840X2160 monitor that is slightly smaller but it is capable of displaying a 4K image resolution. The GT73VR has a single Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 graphics card with 8GB of GDDR5 VRAM and a 2.9GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7-7820 HK processor.</p><p>With 16 GB of DDR4 RAM, the MSI’s Titan series model is perfectly capable of running demanding 4K games, although more RAM memory would probably further improve the notebooks gaming performance.</p><h4 id="5-HP-Omen-17"><a href="#5-HP-Omen-17" class="headerlink" title="5.

The 17.3-inch G-Sync 4K screen delivers accurate colors and amazingly sharp images that will impress even the biggest skeptics. The 2.6GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 6700HQ processor and the VR-enabled Nvidia GeForce 1070 graphics card make the HP Omen 17 a gamer’s dream.

Plain SD Card or Micro SD card"></a>1. Plain SD Card or Micro SD card</h4><p>You can find various models of Micro SD and simple SD cards in the market, but most of the action cameras need Micro SD cards. The significant difference between both these cards is in their dimensions, as Micro SD cards are much smaller in size.</p><p>All latest devices these days are designed with compact size; hence they support micro-sized memory cards for storage of photos and videos.</p><h4 id="2-Speed-Class"><a href="#2-Speed-Class" class="headerlink" title="2. Speed Class"></a>2. Speed Class</h4><p>All SD cards are designed with a special speed class rating that describes their writing data category, and with each type, it represents a real-world recording use for videos.</p><p>Out of all varieties available in the market, the most suitable for action cameras are Class 10 (10Mbps), U3 (30Mbps), and U1 (10Mbps). It would help if you went to U3 and U1 because when your camera is C10 but does not support U1 or U3, it will provide lower data writing speed.</p><p>If you prefer to work on a 1080p resolution, then Class 10 MicroSD card is best for you. These cards are marked with Full HD capabilities that represent 1080p in this case. GoPro action cameras usually support Class 10 and other superior microSD cards, the lower versions will not work.</p><h4 id="3-SD-Card-Storage-Capacity"><a href="#3-SD-Card-Storage-Capacity" class="headerlink" title="3. SD Card Storage Capacity"></a>3. SD Card Storage Capacity</h4><p>The series of GoPro action cameras can handle the certain specific size of microSD cards. The older versions had smaller ratings mostly up to 64GB, whereas the latest devices like Hero4 Silver&#x2F;Black, Hero5 Session, and Hero5 Black support MicroSD cards up to 128GB.</p><p>If you are going to purchase a new MicroSD card for your device, we suggest you check your device specification and pick the card with maximum capacity that your camera can support.</p><h2 id="Top-5-Best-SD-Card-for-GoPro-Hero-8-7-Included"><a href="#Top-5-Best-SD-Card-for-GoPro-Hero-8-7-Included" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 Best SD Card for GoPro (Hero 8&#x2F;7 Included)"></a>Top 5 Best SD Card for GoPro (Hero 8&#x2F;7 Included)</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Memory Cards</th><th>Storage Option</th><th>Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013CP5HCK/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B013CP5HCK&linkId=582b644ee81f409016cbaf187627afc4" >SanDisk Extreme UHS-I Card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td><td>32 GB</td><td>$21</td></tr><tr><td>64 GB</td><td>$37</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XYT37NK/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=mobilead02c70-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06XYT37NK&linkId=52dffcd18a4f034c24859086d331deb2" >SanDisk Extreme PRO microSDXC Memory Card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td><td>64 GB</td><td>$39</td></tr><tr><td><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U77V5KU/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00U77V5KU&linkId=84c83678490b909a696c4285fb4e8ac2" >Lexar Professional 1000x microSDXC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td><td>32 GB</td><td>$33</td></tr><tr><td>64 GB</td><td>$62</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>128 GB</td><td>$130</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IVPU7AO/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00IVPU7AO&linkId=5779f0d393495d92f37773e6b6b636e1" >Samsung EVO Micro SDXC Memory Card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td><td>32 GB</td><td>$16</td></tr><tr><td>64 GB</td><td>$35</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>128 GB</td><td>$50</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N2ROG9O/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00N2ROG9O&linkId=7d3b6a57b3c45e280fd7f4e146efdfbf" >PNY Turbo Performance High-Speed MicroSDXC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td><td>64 GB</td><td>$42</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="1-SANDISK-EXTREME-MICRISDHC-UHS-1-32GB-and-64GB"><a href="#1-SANDISK-EXTREME-MICRISDHC-UHS-1-32GB-and-64GB" class="headerlink" title="1.SANDISK EXTREME MICRISDHC UHS-1 32GB and 64GB:"></a>1.<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013CP5HCK/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B013CP5HCK&linkId=582b644ee81f409016cbaf187627afc4" >SANDISK EXTREME MICRISDHC UHS-1 32GB and 64GB: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sandisk-extreme-microsdhc.jpg" >sandisk-extreme-microsdhc <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013CP5HCK/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B013CP5HCK&linkId=582b644ee81f409016cbaf187627afc4" >https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013CP5HCK/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=vs-flora-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B013CP5HCK&amp;linkId=582b644ee81f409016cbaf187627afc4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013CP5HCK/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B013CP5HCK&linkId=582b644ee81f409016cbaf187627afc4" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Considering SanDisk Extreme memory cards offer high speed with supreme quality, they are the best choice for those who love to explore sites with their action cameras.

The significant difference between both these cards is in their dimensions, as Micro SD cards are much smaller in size.</p><p>All latest devices these days are designed with compact size; hence they support micro-sized memory cards for storage of photos and videos.</p><h4 id="2-Speed-Class-1"><a href="#2-Speed-Class-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

It would help if you went to U3 and U1 because when your camera is C10 but does not support U1 or U3, it will provide lower data writing speed.</p><p>If you prefer to work on a 1080p resolution, then Class 10 MicroSD card is best for you.

In fact, 4K is now what HD was when it became a big deal a few years ago.</p><p>Cable service providers are rolling out 4K UHD channels, broadcasters are working on transmitting in 4K, and streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime already have 4K streaming options.</p><p>We’ve picked the top 10 4K TVs of 2020. This list includes last year’s flagship TVs as well as some that were launched this year. We tell you their pros and cons, and show you the features to look for in a 4K TV. Looking for 8K TVs , check the list of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best 8K TVs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that you can buy right now.</p><h2 id="10-BEST-4K-TVS"><a href="#10-BEST-4K-TVS" class="headerlink" title="10 BEST 4K TVS"></a>10 BEST 4K TVS</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Products</th><th>Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="#tag1">LG OLEDB6P</a></td><td>$2,949.99</td></tr><tr><td><a href="#tag2">SONY XBR-A1E SERIES</a></td><td>$3,298.99</td></tr><tr><td><a href="#tag3">VIZIO M-SERIES</a></td><td>$3,999</td></tr><tr><td><a href="#tag4">Samsung Q9F</a></td><td>$3,797.99</td></tr><tr><td><a href="#tag5">LG OLEDC7P</a></td><td>$3,196.00</td></tr><tr><td><a href="#tag6">LG SJ8500 SERIES</a></td><td>$1,696.99</td></tr><tr><td><a href="#tag7">VIZIO P SERIES</a></td><td>$1,000.00</td></tr><tr><td><a href="#tag8">SAMSUNG QNQ7F SERIES</a></td><td>$3,300.00</td></tr><tr><td><a href="#tag9">SAMSUNG UN75MU8000</a></td><td>$4,199.98</td></tr><tr><td><a href="#tag10">Panasonic TX-58DX802B</a></td><td>$1,500.00</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="1-LG-OLEDB6P"><a href="#1-LG-OLEDB6P" class="headerlink" title="1.

LG OLEDB6P</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lg-oledb6p.jpg"                      alt="lg-oledb6p"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CDF9UTQ/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01CDF9UTQ&linkId=b4be5dd4acad7b31c2564e4bd73f2206" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The LG OLEDB6P made a big splash in 2016 with its superb image quality. It showcases the best of LG’s OLED panel technology. OLEDs or Organic Light Emitting Diodes are self-illuminating LEDs. This makes them better at displaying richer blacks and detailed high-contrast imagery.</p><p>This 4K TV is available in 55” and 65” sizes. It’s also remarkably thin because unlike LCDs, OLEDs do not require a backlight. The LG OLEDB69 is also compatible with HDR and Dolby Vision. Its ability to handle multiple HDR formats is a big deal now that HDR is more popular and more widely used.</p><p>On the downside, the LG OLEDB6P is quite expensive. At roughly $2800, it just won’t fit into the budgets of most people. Also, due to its OLED panel, it has a brightness limit that means it could look dim in some indoor viewing conditions. We should point out that this won’t always be an issue since most people modulate the brightness of their TV and PC screens. With its fantastic image quality, this 4K TV is worth the expense for many.</p><h4 id="2-SONY-XBR-A1E-SERIES"><a href="#2-SONY-XBR-A1E-SERIES" class="headerlink" title="2. SONY XBR-A1E SERIES"></a>2. SONY XBR-A1E SERIES</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sony-xbr-a1e-series.jpg"                      alt="sony-xbr-a1e-series"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XD4QHQB/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06XD4QHQB&linkId=b3bc8962ae824737e52e86720fd1c68e" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The Sony XBR-AIE OLED TV was one of many stars at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show. It is Sony’s flagship TV of the year and marks the company’s foray into OLED panel technology. This OLED TV is remarkable for many reasons. It delivers flawlessly on image quality with dynamic contrast, rich blacks and bright highlights.</p><p>The Sony XBR-A1E also debuted Sony’s unique sound creation system. Its OLED panel also doubles as a speaker with inbuilt devices that vibrate it to create good quality sound. This TV also sports an ultra-minimalist look that will instantly grab attention and set a sophisticated tone in any space.</p><p>All pluses considered, this 4K TV is even more expensive than the No. 1 TV on this list. It retails for a minimum of $3500. That’s more than most people would ever spend on a TV. Also, its unique sound system is not nearly sufficient for a truly immersive entertainment experience.</p><h4 id="3-VIZIO-M-SERIES"><a href="#3-VIZIO-M-SERIES" class="headerlink" title="3. VIZIO M SERIES"></a>3. VIZIO M SERIES</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vizio-m-series.jpg"                      alt="vizio-m-series"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00T63YMGK/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00T63YMGK&linkId=a1942303876dfef63c6712f5a901c420" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The Vizio M Series is a fantastic range of affordable LCD 4K TVs. For as low as $600, the Vizio M delivers great value for money and is quite popular with shoppers. With its full array local dimming, it renders rich blacks, better image depth, and has overall, amazing image quality. The 2017 release is also compatible with HDR and is especially good for video gaming.</p><p>While its price range makes it a steal, image quality is reduced when the Vizio M is viewed from angles. Also, screen reflection interferes with image quality especially at angles. This makes the Vizio M less than ideal for multi-viewer situations.</p><h4 id="4-SAMSUNG-Q9F"><a href="#4-SAMSUNG-Q9F" class="headerlink" title="4. SAMSUNG Q9F"></a>4. SAMSUNG Q9F</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/samsung-q9f.jpg"                      alt="samsung-q9f"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XGXFPXG/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06XGXFPXG&linkId=b578d0514e5cd92ab0e1eea2338fe201" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The Samsung Q9F made a big impression at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show. It uses Samsung’s proprietary metal-wrapped Quantum Dots (QLED) to improve the colour and contrast range of its LCD screen. This TV does improve significantly on the native flaws of backlit LCD panels and has the record brightness levels of LCD screens. The Q9F is also compatible with multiple HDR formats.</p><p>Though it lacks the ultra-thin look of OLED TVs, the Q9F has an impressive industrial style that gives it a quietly imposing look in any space.</p><p>While Samsung gets kudos for its Quantum Dot LED technology, the Q9F is super expensive. With a retail price tag of $4997, it’s the most expensive 4K TV on this list. Also, its rendering of HDR colour isn’t always perfect. Some testers have observed HDR colour banding or striping.</p><h4 id="5-LG-OLEDC7P"><a href="#5-LG-OLEDC7P" class="headerlink" title="5. LG OLEDC7P"></a>5. LG OLEDC7P</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lg-oledc7p.jpg"                      alt="lg-oledc7p"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NAYM1TP/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01NAYM1TP&linkId=b87b8d8bc4021a635c401e47f9e8066b" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The C7P series is a great addition to LGs line of OLED products. Its minimal flush bezels and ultra-slim panel have a sophisticated, high-tech feel that’s a step-up from the B6P model. It has great picture quality and support for HDR content. Also, image quality is preserved when the screen is viewed from angles. The C7P also has a high refresh rate of 120Hz which makes it perfect for fast-action video games.</p><p>The C7Ps are high-end 4K TVs. The 55” C7P retails for roughly $2999. That makes it a premium purchase. As with other OLEDs, the C7Ps also has limited peak brightness and may sometimes show image retention.</p><h4 id="6-LG-SJ8500-SERIES"><a href="#6-LG-SJ8500-SERIES" class="headerlink" title="6. LG SJ8500 SERIES"></a>6. LG SJ8500 SERIES</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lg-sj8500-series.jpg"                      alt="lg-sj8500-series"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N4TQ7O4/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01N4TQ7O4&linkId=8b557fc6e4ac02af49c0d1612831cf82" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The LG SJ8500 is a solid mid-priced LED TV that offers a good mix of features. It’s built with IPS Panels which make it good at retaining image quality and colour quality at different angles. It’s also good at upscaling lower HD content. That’s important because while 4K content is no longer scarce, it still comes at a premium. The SJ8500 makes older HD content look consistently better and that’s something many shoppers will appreciate.</p><p>It has a 120Hz refresh rate with low input lag and motion blur which is good for video gaming. It also retails for less than $1300.</p><p>While its overall mix of features is great, image quality isn’t perfect on the SJ8500. Some colours appear blotchy and picture contrast is not nearly as good as with OLED or QLED screens.</p><h4 id="7-Vizio-P-Series"><a href="#7-Vizio-P-Series" class="headerlink" title="7. Vizio P Series"></a>7. Vizio P Series</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vizio-p-series.jpg"                      alt="vizio-p-series"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016C64ENE/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B016C64ENE&linkId=6336080b7f7e1c924dc675e8ed205723" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The Vizio P is an improved version of the Vizio M series. It’s an LED TV that uses local dimming zones and brightness enhancements to improve image quality. It was rated tops for image quality in dark viewing situations and has good support for HDR content.</p><p>It comes in 4 sizes ranging from 50” to 75”. It’s also very affordably priced with the 50” retailing for a bit more than $800. The sizes have different features however and shoppers should keep this in mind when weighting their options. For instance, all sizes except the 50” have a refresh rate of 120Hz.</p><p>On the downside, the Vizio P’s screen reflects light when used in brightly lit room. Image quality also diminishes significantly when it’s viewed from angles. Finally, it doesn’t have a native smart TV OS. Instead, it’s controlled via an android app and can handle Google Chromecast streaming through its accompanying tablet.</p><h4 id="8-Samsung-QNQ7F-series"><a href="#8-Samsung-QNQ7F-series" class="headerlink" title="8. Samsung QNQ7F series"></a>8. Samsung QNQ7F series</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/samsung-qnq7f.jpg"                      alt="vizio-p-series"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NAYM755/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01NAYM755&linkId=4cc6d5b2628955f1745d8531818bd693" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The Samsung QNQ7F series is a range of QLED 4K TVs that’s superbly well-designed. It has an elegant no-bezel screen that can make watching movies more immersive. It also has a sleek, cable-free look because it uses a fibre optic cable to connect the TV panel to the One Connect Box where its connection ports are housed. The fibre optic cable is 16ft long and is designed to let users stow the One Connect Box neatly out of sight while using their TVs. The QNQ7F has a very sophisticated, polished looked due to this impressive design.</p><p>The QNQ however, is not as good as the Q9F when it comes to image quality.

In fact, 4K is now what HD was when it became a big deal a few years ago.</p><p>Cable service providers are rolling out 4K UHD channels, broadcasters are working on transmitting in 4K, and streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime already have 4K streaming options.</p><p>We’ve picked the top 10 4K TVs of 2020.

It showcases the best of LG’s OLED panel technology. OLEDs or Organic Light Emitting Diodes are self-illuminating LEDs. This makes them better at displaying richer blacks and detailed high-contrast imagery.</p><p>This 4K TV is available in 55” and 65” sizes. It’s also remarkably thin because unlike LCDs, OLEDs do not require a backlight. The LG OLEDB69 is also compatible with HDR and Dolby Vision. Its ability to handle multiple HDR formats is a big deal now that HDR is more popular and more widely used.</p><p>On the downside, the LG OLEDB6P is quite expensive. At roughly $2800, it just won’t fit into the budgets of most people. Also, due to its OLED panel, it has a brightness limit that means it could look dim in some indoor viewing conditions. We should point out that this won’t always be an issue since most people modulate the brightness of their TV and PC screens. With its fantastic image quality, this 4K TV is worth the expense for many.</p><h4 id="2-SONY-XBR-A1E-SERIES-1"><a href="#2-SONY-XBR-A1E-SERIES-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

It is Sony’s flagship TV of the year and marks the company’s foray into OLED panel technology. This OLED TV is remarkable for many reasons. It delivers flawlessly on image quality with dynamic contrast, rich blacks and bright highlights.</p><p>The Sony XBR-A1E also debuted Sony’s unique sound creation system. Its OLED panel also doubles as a speaker with inbuilt devices that vibrate it to create good quality sound. This TV also sports an ultra-minimalist look that will instantly grab attention and set a sophisticated tone in any space.</p><p>All pluses considered, this 4K TV is even more expensive than the No. 1 TV on this list. It retails for a minimum of $3500. That’s more than most people would ever spend on a TV. Also, its unique sound system is not nearly sufficient for a truly immersive entertainment experience.</p><h4 id="3-VIZIO-M-SERIES-1"><a href="#3-VIZIO-M-SERIES-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

With its full array local dimming, it renders rich blacks, better image depth, and has overall, amazing image quality. The 2017 release is also compatible with HDR and is especially good for video gaming.</p><p>While its price range makes it a steal, image quality is reduced when the Vizio M is viewed from angles.

It uses Samsung’s proprietary metal-wrapped Quantum Dots (QLED) to improve the colour and contrast range of its LCD screen. This TV does improve significantly on the native flaws of backlit LCD panels and has the record brightness levels of LCD screens. The Q9F is also compatible with multiple HDR formats.</p><p>Though it lacks the ultra-thin look of OLED TVs, the Q9F has an impressive industrial style that gives it a quietly imposing look in any space.</p><p>While Samsung gets kudos for its Quantum Dot LED technology, the Q9F is super expensive. With a retail price tag of $4997, it’s the most expensive 4K TV on this list. Also, its rendering of HDR colour isn’t always perfect. Some testers have observed HDR colour banding or striping.</p><h4 id="5-LG-OLEDC7P-1"><a href="#5-LG-OLEDC7P-1" class="headerlink" title="5. LG OLEDC7P"></a>5.

Its minimal flush bezels and ultra-slim panel have a sophisticated, high-tech feel that’s a step-up from the B6P model. It has great picture quality and support for HDR content. Also, image quality is preserved when the screen is viewed from angles. The C7P also has a high refresh rate of 120Hz which makes it perfect for fast-action video games.</p><p>The C7Ps are high-end 4K TVs. The 55” C7P retails for roughly $2999.

It’s built with IPS Panels which make it good at retaining image quality and colour quality at different angles. It’s also good at upscaling lower HD content. That’s important because while 4K content is no longer scarce, it still comes at a premium. The SJ8500 makes older HD content look consistently better and that’s something many shoppers will appreciate.</p><p>It has a 120Hz refresh rate with low input lag and motion blur which is good for video gaming.

It’s also very affordably priced with the 50” retailing for a bit more than $800. The sizes have different features however and shoppers should keep this in mind when weighting their options. For instance, all sizes except the 50” have a refresh rate of 120Hz.</p><p>On the downside, the Vizio P’s screen reflects light when used in brightly lit room. Image quality also diminishes significantly when it’s viewed from angles. Finally, it doesn’t have a native smart TV OS.

The fibre optic cable is 16ft long and is designed to let users stow the One Connect Box neatly out of sight while using their TVs. The QNQ7F has a very sophisticated, polished looked due to this impressive design.</p><p>The QNQ however, is not as good as the Q9F when it comes to image quality.

It showcases the best of LG’s OLED panel technology. OLEDs or Organic Light Emitting Diodes are self-illuminating LEDs. This makes them better at displaying richer blacks and detailed high-contrast imagery.</p><p>This 4K TV is available in 55” and 65” sizes. It’s also remarkably thin because unlike LCDs, OLEDs do not require a backlight. The LG OLEDB69 is also compatible with HDR and Dolby Vision. Its ability to handle multiple HDR formats is a big deal now that HDR is more popular and more widely used.</p><p>On the downside, the LG OLEDB6P is quite expensive. At roughly $2800, it just won’t fit into the budgets of most people. Also, due to its OLED panel, it has a brightness limit that means it could look dim in some indoor viewing conditions. We should point out that this won’t always be an issue since most people modulate the brightness of their TV and PC screens. With its fantastic image quality, this 4K TV is worth the expense for many.</p><h4 id="2-SONY-XBR-A1E-SERIES-2"><a href="#2-SONY-XBR-A1E-SERIES-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

It is Sony’s flagship TV of the year and marks the company’s foray into OLED panel technology. This OLED TV is remarkable for many reasons. It delivers flawlessly on image quality with dynamic contrast, rich blacks and bright highlights.</p><p>The Sony XBR-A1E also debuted Sony’s unique sound creation system. Its OLED panel also doubles as a speaker with inbuilt devices that vibrate it to create good quality sound. This TV also sports an ultra-minimalist look that will instantly grab attention and set a sophisticated tone in any space.</p><p>All pluses considered, this 4K TV is even more expensive than the No. 1 TV on this list. It retails for a minimum of $3500. That’s more than most people would ever spend on a TV. Also, its unique sound system is not nearly sufficient for a truly immersive entertainment experience.</p><h4 id="3-VIZIO-M-SERIES-2"><a href="#3-VIZIO-M-SERIES-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

For as low as $600, the Vizio M delivers great value for money and is quite popular with shoppers. With its full array local dimming, it renders rich blacks, better image depth, and has overall, amazing image quality. The 2017 release is also compatible with HDR and is especially good for video gaming.</p><p>While its price range makes it a steal, image quality is reduced when the Vizio M is viewed from angles. Also, screen reflection interferes with image quality especially at angles. This makes the Vizio M less than ideal for multi-viewer situations.</p><h4 id="4-SAMSUNG-Q9F-2"><a href="#4-SAMSUNG-Q9F-2" class="headerlink" title="4. SAMSUNG Q9F"></a>4.

It uses Samsung’s proprietary metal-wrapped Quantum Dots (QLED) to improve the colour and contrast range of its LCD screen. This TV does improve significantly on the native flaws of backlit LCD panels and has the record brightness levels of LCD screens. The Q9F is also compatible with multiple HDR formats.</p><p>Though it lacks the ultra-thin look of OLED TVs, the Q9F has an impressive industrial style that gives it a quietly imposing look in any space.</p><p>While Samsung gets kudos for its Quantum Dot LED technology, the Q9F is super expensive. With a retail price tag of $4997, it’s the most expensive 4K TV on this list. Also, its rendering of HDR colour isn’t always perfect. Some testers have observed HDR colour banding or striping.</p><h4 id="5-LG-OLEDC7P-2"><a href="#5-LG-OLEDC7P-2" class="headerlink" title="5. LG OLEDC7P"></a>5.

Its minimal flush bezels and ultra-slim panel have a sophisticated, high-tech feel that’s a step-up from the B6P model. It has great picture quality and support for HDR content. Also, image quality is preserved when the screen is viewed from angles. The C7P also has a high refresh rate of 120Hz which makes it perfect for fast-action video games.</p><p>The C7Ps are high-end 4K TVs. The 55” C7P retails for roughly $2999.

It’s built with IPS Panels which make it good at retaining image quality and colour quality at different angles. It’s also good at upscaling lower HD content. That’s important because while 4K content is no longer scarce, it still comes at a premium. The SJ8500 makes older HD content look consistently better and that’s something many shoppers will appreciate.</p><p>It has a 120Hz refresh rate with low input lag and motion blur which is good for video gaming. It also retails for less than $1300.</p><p>While its overall mix of features is great, image quality isn’t perfect on the SJ8500.

It’s also very affordably priced with the 50” retailing for a bit more than $800. The sizes have different features however and shoppers should keep this in mind when weighting their options. For instance, all sizes except the 50” have a refresh rate of 120Hz.</p><p>On the downside, the Vizio P’s screen reflects light when used in brightly lit room. Image quality also diminishes significantly when it’s viewed from angles. Finally, it doesn’t have a native smart TV OS.

The fibre optic cable is 16ft long and is designed to let users stow the One Connect Box neatly out of sight while using their TVs. The QNQ7F has a very sophisticated, polished looked due to this impressive design.</p><p>The QNQ however, is not as good as the Q9F when it comes to image quality.

It showcases the best of LG’s OLED panel technology. OLEDs or Organic Light Emitting Diodes are self-illuminating LEDs. This makes them better at displaying richer blacks and detailed high-contrast imagery.</p><p>This 4K TV is available in 55” and 65” sizes. It’s also remarkably thin because unlike LCDs, OLEDs do not require a backlight. The LG OLEDB69 is also compatible with HDR and Dolby Vision. Its ability to handle multiple HDR formats is a big deal now that HDR is more popular and more widely used.</p><p>On the downside, the LG OLEDB6P is quite expensive. At roughly $2800, it just won’t fit into the budgets of most people. Also, due to its OLED panel, it has a brightness limit that means it could look dim in some indoor viewing conditions. We should point out that this won’t always be an issue since most people modulate the brightness of their TV and PC screens. With its fantastic image quality, this 4K TV is worth the expense for many.</p><h4 id="2-SONY-XBR-A1E-SERIES-3"><a href="#2-SONY-XBR-A1E-SERIES-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

It is Sony’s flagship TV of the year and marks the company’s foray into OLED panel technology. This OLED TV is remarkable for many reasons. It delivers flawlessly on image quality with dynamic contrast, rich blacks and bright highlights.</p><p>The Sony XBR-A1E also debuted Sony’s unique sound creation system. Its OLED panel also doubles as a speaker with inbuilt devices that vibrate it to create good quality sound. This TV also sports an ultra-minimalist look that will instantly grab attention and set a sophisticated tone in any space.</p><p>All pluses considered, this 4K TV is even more expensive than the No. 1 TV on this list. It retails for a minimum of $3500. That’s more than most people would ever spend on a TV. Also, its unique sound system is not nearly sufficient for a truly immersive entertainment experience.</p><h4 id="3-VIZIO-M-SERIES-3"><a href="#3-VIZIO-M-SERIES-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

For as low as $600, the Vizio M delivers great value for money and is quite popular with shoppers. With its full array local dimming, it renders rich blacks, better image depth, and has overall, amazing image quality. The 2017 release is also compatible with HDR and is especially good for video gaming.</p><p>While its price range makes it a steal, image quality is reduced when the Vizio M is viewed from angles. Also, screen reflection interferes with image quality especially at angles. This makes the Vizio M less than ideal for multi-viewer situations.</p><h4 id="4-SAMSUNG-Q9F-3"><a href="#4-SAMSUNG-Q9F-3" class="headerlink" title="4. SAMSUNG Q9F"></a>4.

It uses Samsung’s proprietary metal-wrapped Quantum Dots (QLED) to improve the colour and contrast range of its LCD screen. This TV does improve significantly on the native flaws of backlit LCD panels and has the record brightness levels of LCD screens. The Q9F is also compatible with multiple HDR formats.</p><p>Though it lacks the ultra-thin look of OLED TVs, the Q9F has an impressive industrial style that gives it a quietly imposing look in any space.</p><p>While Samsung gets kudos for its Quantum Dot LED technology, the Q9F is super expensive. With a retail price tag of $4997, it’s the most expensive 4K TV on this list. Also, its rendering of HDR colour isn’t always perfect. Some testers have observed HDR colour banding or striping.</p><h4 id="5-LG-OLEDC7P-3"><a href="#5-LG-OLEDC7P-3" class="headerlink" title="5. LG OLEDC7P"></a>5.

Its minimal flush bezels and ultra-slim panel have a sophisticated, high-tech feel that’s a step-up from the B6P model. It has great picture quality and support for HDR content. Also, image quality is preserved when the screen is viewed from angles. The C7P also has a high refresh rate of 120Hz which makes it perfect for fast-action video games.</p><p>The C7Ps are high-end 4K TVs. The 55” C7P retails for roughly $2999. That makes it a premium purchase. As with other OLEDs, the C7Ps also has limited peak brightness and may sometimes show image retention.</p><h4 id="6-LG-SJ8500-SERIES-3"><a href="#6-LG-SJ8500-SERIES-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

It’s built with IPS Panels which make it good at retaining image quality and colour quality at different angles. It’s also good at upscaling lower HD content. That’s important because while 4K content is no longer scarce, it still comes at a premium. The SJ8500 makes older HD content look consistently better and that’s something many shoppers will appreciate.</p><p>It has a 120Hz refresh rate with low input lag and motion blur which is good for video gaming. It also retails for less than $1300.</p><p>While its overall mix of features is great, image quality isn’t perfect on the SJ8500. Some colours appear blotchy and picture contrast is not nearly as good as with OLED or QLED screens.</p><h4 id="7-Vizio-P-Series-3"><a href="#7-Vizio-P-Series-3" class="headerlink" title="7.

It’s an LED TV that uses local dimming zones and brightness enhancements to improve image quality. It was rated tops for image quality in dark viewing situations and has good support for HDR content.</p><p>It comes in 4 sizes ranging from 50” to 75”. It’s also very affordably priced with the 50” retailing for a bit more than $800. The sizes have different features however and shoppers should keep this in mind when weighting their options. For instance, all sizes except the 50” have a refresh rate of 120Hz.</p><p>On the downside, the Vizio P’s screen reflects light when used in brightly lit room. Image quality also diminishes significantly when it’s viewed from angles. Finally, it doesn’t have a native smart TV OS. Instead, it’s controlled via an android app and can handle Google Chromecast streaming through its accompanying tablet.</p><h4 id="8-Samsung-QNQ7F-series-3"><a href="#8-Samsung-QNQ7F-series-3" class="headerlink" title="8.

It has an elegant no-bezel screen that can make watching movies more immersive. It also has a sleek, cable-free look because it uses a fibre optic cable to connect the TV panel to the One Connect Box where its connection ports are housed. The fibre optic cable is 16ft long and is designed to let users stow the One Connect Box neatly out of sight while using their TVs. The QNQ7F has a very sophisticated, polished looked due to this impressive design.</p><p>The QNQ however, is not as good as the Q9F when it comes to image quality. It doesn’t show Samsung’s QLED technology at its best. It’s also quite expensive with a retail price of $2997.</p><h4 id="9-SAMSUNG-UN75MU800D-3"><a href="#9-SAMSUNG-UN75MU800D-3" class="headerlink" title="9. SAMSUNG UN75MU800D"></a>9.

It’s 75” wide and has an edge-lit LCD screen. It has a whopping 240Hz refresh rate which ensures that motion blur and input lag won’t interfere with fast-action video games.</p><p>This large 4K TV is also internet-enabled. It can connect to the internet wirelessly or through an ethernet cable. This means it can work with streaming services like Netflix and Vudu. It also comes with a detached connections box as well as a concealed connections panel behind the screen. So, it can handle many external devices including PCs and digital cameras.</p><p>This TV is ideal for people who want to recreate a cinematic experience at home. Otherwise, it’s a bit too imposing for a family living room. Also, it’s very expensive. At $4000, the Samsung UN75MU800D is a luxury most cannot afford.</p><h4 id="10-Panasonic-TX-58DX802B-3"><a href="#10-Panasonic-TX-58DX802B-3" class="headerlink" title="10.

It comes with an exceptionally elegant easel stand made in conjunction with an Italian designer. Its stand, which has a silver metallic finish, is also quite stable. The DX802 has a detachable sound bar that performs very well for a home entertainment system. Also, the screen and sound bar can both be mounted on a wall.</p><p>The picture quality on the DX802 is remarkably good. It supports HDR well and delivers images with great depth and colour. Its edge-lit panel and local dimming feature delivers good colour, brightness and contrast for HD content.</p><p>While its design puts it in a class of its own, the colour coverage and brightness levels of the DX802 could be better. Also, this 4K TV is somewhat expensive. It’s 50” version is nearly $1500. That said, some shoppers may consider this a fair price for a product that’s so well-designed.</p><h3 id="Best-4K-TVs-CONCLUSION-3"><a href="#Best-4K-TVs-CONCLUSION-3" class="headerlink" title="Best 4K TVs - CONCLUSION"></a>Best 4K TVs - CONCLUSION</h3><p>With bigger screens and out-of-the-box support for internet streaming services, 4K TVs are a big step up for home-viewing entertainment systems.

Instead of using multiple lenses, the VSN 360 relies on a single camera and a conical mirror to capture its 360-degree view. Retailing for around $449, this camera is less expensive than some, but more expensive, and tougher, than the 360-cams designed for more mundane uses. Some people criticize its video quality, but then, it was an early entrant in a category that is growing rapidly.

At $449, this is slightly less expensive than other cameras. Like the Keymission, this camera is built like a tank, resistant to water, shocks, and dust. However, unlike the Keymission, it is not waterproof, so I wouldn’t take it swimming with you. It shoots stills with 8MP resolution, and 2880x2880 video. For many people, the quality of the images shot by the Kodak camera just doesn’t measure up to other 360-degree cameras.

The camera is best controlled through the app, available for iOS or Android, but can also be run in a rudimentary fashion using the buttons on the device.

Conversion LUTs</h4><p>You use these for the technical aspects of video editing. For example, you can apply them to your iPhone footage to make it compatible with TV displays. Conversion LUTs mainly address issues such as:</p><ul><li>Video resolution</li><li>Video calibration</li><li>Red eyes</li><li>White Balance</li><li>Color formats</li></ul><p>As such, you will only use conversion LUTs at the initial stage of post-production to ensure your video is compatible with the intended display device.</p><h4 id="2-Creative-LUTs"><a href="#2-Creative-LUTs" class="headerlink" title="2.

You can apply them for any type of footage from equipment such as smartphones and professional cameras. Additionally, they are compatible across different video editing software including Adobe Creative Suite, DaVinci Resolve, and Filmora (more about this later).</p><p>Furthermore, LUTs fall under two broad categories that signify their function. They are as below:</p><h4 id="1-Conversion-LUTs-2"><a href="#1-Conversion-LUTs-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Conversion LUTs"></a>1. Conversion LUTs</h4><p>You use these for the technical aspects of video editing. For example, you can apply them to your iPhone footage to make it compatible with TV displays. Conversion LUTs mainly address issues such as:</p><ul><li>Video resolution</li><li>Video calibration</li><li>Red eyes</li><li>White Balance</li><li>Color formats</li></ul><p>As such, you will only use conversion LUTs at the initial stage of post-production to ensure your video is compatible with the intended display device.</p><h4 id="2-Creative-LUTs-2"><a href="#2-Creative-LUTs-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Creative LUTs"></a>2. Creative LUTs</h4><p>Creative LUTs allow you more creative freedom with your footage since they focus on the artistry aspect. Depending on the setting, you will also hear them referred to as film or cinematic LUTs. Additionally, creative LUTs allow you to further customize your videos to achieve various objectives as you shall see below.</p><p>Filmmakers use the best cinema luts to fulfill the following roles:</p><h4 id="•-To-complete-film-projects-with-a-tight-deadline-2"><a href="#•-To-complete-film-projects-with-a-tight-deadline-2" class="headerlink" title="• To complete film projects with a tight deadline"></a>• To complete film projects with a tight deadline</h4><p>Sometimes the studio may require the film before the agreed timeline. As such, you do not have enough time to complete the finer details of color correction and color grading. Cinematic color LUTs allow you to apply preset finishes to achieve the desired outcome quickly. For example, you can use FIlmora’s Game of Thrones LUT to quickly apply a cool effect to your video.</p><h4 id="•-It-provides-a-foundation-to-develop-your-unique-creative-style-2"><a href="#•-It-provides-a-foundation-to-develop-your-unique-creative-style-2" class="headerlink" title="• It provides a foundation to develop your unique creative style"></a>• It provides a foundation to develop your unique creative style</h4><p>You can use LUTs to establish the base of your video editing style. For example, you can apply cinematic color LUTs from Ridley Scott movies and refine them to formulate your creative identity. As such, your work becomes instantly recognizable, and your reputation grows.</p><h4 id="•-They-are-crucial-to-maintaining-the-studio’s-high-production-value-2"><a href="#•-They-are-crucial-to-maintaining-the-studio’s-high-production-value-2" class="headerlink" title="• They are crucial to maintaining the studio’s high production value"></a>• They are crucial to maintaining the studio’s high production value</h4><p>Every production house strives to maintain a certain level of production value. As such, they grow an audience, ensuring that their films always generate income upon release. Using a shared library of cinematic luts, the studio maintains consistent video production quality.</p><h4 id="•-To-inspire-a-specific-feeling-and-theme-2"><a href="#•-To-inspire-a-specific-feeling-and-theme-2" class="headerlink" title="• To inspire a specific feeling and theme"></a>• To inspire a specific feeling and theme</h4><p>Did you know you can distinguish film genres by their color grading techniques? For example, warm color grading is synonymous with romantic comedies, and deep blue color schemes are for sci-fi movies.</p><h4 id="•-To-translate-a-set-of-colors-to-another-video-editing-software-2"><a href="#•-To-translate-a-set-of-colors-to-another-video-editing-software-2" class="headerlink" title="• To translate a set of colors to another video editing software"></a>• To translate a set of colors to another video editing software</h4><p>Most films undergo editing across different software to ensure a perfect finish. However, you may encounter a situation where some hues are incompatible across their software. Studios use cinematic luts to overcome this challenge resulting in continuity in the post-production process.</p><h4 id="•-Conversion-of-Log-footage-2"><a href="#•-Conversion-of-Log-footage-2" class="headerlink" title="• Conversion of Log footage"></a>• Conversion of Log footage</h4><p>Conversion cinematic luts help film editors convert log footage to the simpler Rec709 format.

You can apply them for any type of footage from equipment such as smartphones and professional cameras. Additionally, they are compatible across different video editing software including Adobe Creative Suite, DaVinci Resolve, and Filmora (more about this later).</p><p>Furthermore, LUTs fall under two broad categories that signify their function. They are as below:</p><h4 id="1-Conversion-LUTs-3"><a href="#1-Conversion-LUTs-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Conversion LUTs"></a>1. Conversion LUTs</h4><p>You use these for the technical aspects of video editing. For example, you can apply them to your iPhone footage to make it compatible with TV displays. Conversion LUTs mainly address issues such as:</p><ul><li>Video resolution</li><li>Video calibration</li><li>Red eyes</li><li>White Balance</li><li>Color formats</li></ul><p>As such, you will only use conversion LUTs at the initial stage of post-production to ensure your video is compatible with the intended display device.</p><h4 id="2-Creative-LUTs-3"><a href="#2-Creative-LUTs-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Creative LUTs"></a>2. Creative LUTs</h4><p>Creative LUTs allow you more creative freedom with your footage since they focus on the artistry aspect. Depending on the setting, you will also hear them referred to as film or cinematic LUTs. Additionally, creative LUTs allow you to further customize your videos to achieve various objectives as you shall see below.</p><p>Filmmakers use the best cinema luts to fulfill the following roles:</p><h4 id="•-To-complete-film-projects-with-a-tight-deadline-3"><a href="#•-To-complete-film-projects-with-a-tight-deadline-3" class="headerlink" title="• To complete film projects with a tight deadline"></a>• To complete film projects with a tight deadline</h4><p>Sometimes the studio may require the film before the agreed timeline. As such, you do not have enough time to complete the finer details of color correction and color grading. Cinematic color LUTs allow you to apply preset finishes to achieve the desired outcome quickly. For example, you can use FIlmora’s Game of Thrones LUT to quickly apply a cool effect to your video.</p><h4 id="•-It-provides-a-foundation-to-develop-your-unique-creative-style-3"><a href="#•-It-provides-a-foundation-to-develop-your-unique-creative-style-3" class="headerlink" title="• It provides a foundation to develop your unique creative style"></a>• It provides a foundation to develop your unique creative style</h4><p>You can use LUTs to establish the base of your video editing style. For example, you can apply cinematic color LUTs from Ridley Scott movies and refine them to formulate your creative identity. As such, your work becomes instantly recognizable, and your reputation grows.</p><h4 id="•-They-are-crucial-to-maintaining-the-studio’s-high-production-value-3"><a href="#•-They-are-crucial-to-maintaining-the-studio’s-high-production-value-3" class="headerlink" title="• They are crucial to maintaining the studio’s high production value"></a>• They are crucial to maintaining the studio’s high production value</h4><p>Every production house strives to maintain a certain level of production value. As such, they grow an audience, ensuring that their films always generate income upon release. Using a shared library of cinematic luts, the studio maintains consistent video production quality.</p><h4 id="•-To-inspire-a-specific-feeling-and-theme-3"><a href="#•-To-inspire-a-specific-feeling-and-theme-3" class="headerlink" title="• To inspire a specific feeling and theme"></a>• To inspire a specific feeling and theme</h4><p>Did you know you can distinguish film genres by their color grading techniques? For example, warm color grading is synonymous with romantic comedies, and deep blue color schemes are for sci-fi movies.</p><h4 id="•-To-translate-a-set-of-colors-to-another-video-editing-software-3"><a href="#•-To-translate-a-set-of-colors-to-another-video-editing-software-3" class="headerlink" title="• To translate a set of colors to another video editing software"></a>• To translate a set of colors to another video editing software</h4><p>Most films undergo editing across different software to ensure a perfect finish. However, you may encounter a situation where some hues are incompatible across their software. Studios use cinematic luts to overcome this challenge resulting in continuity in the post-production process.</p><h4 id="•-Conversion-of-Log-footage-3"><a href="#•-Conversion-of-Log-footage-3" class="headerlink" title="• Conversion of Log footage"></a>• Conversion of Log footage</h4><p>Conversion cinematic luts help film editors convert log footage to the simpler Rec709 format.

You can easily save time when you use it, because you can capture the interior footage you want with little to no effort. They did a very good job at bringing a 120 FPS mode. The 12 MP still photos also have a very good quality, which is really what you want to have with this model.

You need to make sure that you study the soil and field quality, not to mention you need to assess the health and irrigation of your crops. The DJI Agras MG-1 does a very good job here because its battery lasts for around 24 minutes. It’s a heavy drone at around 8.8 kg, but then again you do have a good and reliable drone that can be monitored and used in any way you want. The liquid tank capacity has around 10 liters and you can use it for spraying as well. They added a smart mode too and the motor is very good at managing battery power. It’s one of the best and most efficient drones out there for agricultural use and the experience you get from using it is very good.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> great features for agricultural use, suitable for spraying crops, great flight time duration</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive (Almost $15000), maneuverability can be better.</p><h4 id="4-Best-professional-drones-for-mapping-and-surveying-3DR-Site-Scan"><a href="#4-Best-professional-drones-for-mapping-and-surveying-3DR-Site-Scan" class="headerlink" title="4.

The price of around $12000 seems rather prohibitive, but the drone is particularly used for taking pictures and it does a very good job at that. It’s very stable and the camera comes with a stabilizer, so each one of the pictures works great and it manages to deliver an incredible value for your money because of that reason alone. You can use the captured images and footage to convert it into 3D models and contour maps if you want.</p><p> It works great for both enterprise and startup use, not to mention that its mapping features are great and to the point. You can charge it for around 1.5 hours, which is a pretty good time for a regular drone.</p><p> Also, you can outline the area that you want to survey on the map and the drone will fly itself. This is a nifty feature and one that many professional drones should start using sooner rather than later.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> You can outline the desired region and make it fly automatically, great image quality, stable and with a great performance.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong>  the price of around $12000 is rather high</p><h4 id="5-Best-drones-for-surveillance-Yuneec-Q500-Typhoon"><a href="#5-Best-drones-for-surveillance-Yuneec-Q500-Typhoon" class="headerlink" title="5.

It’s light at around 1.1kg, not to mention that it costs solely $800, so it’s not an expensive purchase either. Thanks to the 4K video and the 25 minutes of usage, you can easily capture great footage and use it without any problem in a wide variety of situations. The quality you receive is very good and the experience as a whole is a very distinct one. You should consider giving it a try because it does have all the best video capture features out there and it works really well.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> amazing video capture capabilities, great price, lightweight, durable battery</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> controls are a bit iffy at times</p><p> All these professional drones are great for a particular industry. If you really need this type of drone, you have to focus on each one of the individual industries and you have to focus on the value that it can deliver. Just consider checking these out and you will be rather impressed with the great experience you can receive in the end.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><h5 id="Max-Wales-1"><a href="#Max-Wales-1" class="headerlink" title="Max Wales"></a>Max Wales</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> The professional drones are designed to bring in features that suit business activities.

The device costs around $6200, and it manages to bring in a weight of around 40 pounds. At a speed of 93km&#x2F;h, it’s very fast and it can bring you a 5.2k camera. It’s definitely one of the best drones that can bring you complete aerial photography and a set of resounding features for your money. The manufacturer added multi-rotor features here and the fact that you can easily capture anything with great detail works to your advantage.</p><p> Aside from that, here you have a dual battery design which is rather distinct and you also acquire a very fast acceleration. This means you get to capture the videos you want on the spot and that on its own is rather wonderful to say the least. It’s one of the better professional drones as well, and at this price you can’t really ask for more. Is it worth it? Yes, you do get plenty of value for your money and if you are a professional film maker or photographer, you can make quite a lot of money from it.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> very easy to use and maneuver, fast, 27 minutes of flight time and 5.2k camera</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> expensive and pretty heavy</p><h4 id="2-Best-drone-for-real-estate-use-DJI-Phantom-4-3"><a href="#2-Best-drone-for-real-estate-use-DJI-Phantom-4-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

DJI Phantom 4 is offering you full 4K captures and it does a very good job with the flight time which is 28 minutes. At 8.82 pounds, it’s not very heavy and you can maneuver it with is. You can easily save time when you use it, because you can capture the interior footage you want with little to no effort. They did a very good job at bringing a 120 FPS mode. The 12 MP still photos also have a very good quality, which is really what you want to have with this model. The combination of great photos and videos made with this drone show the unique value you can receive from it, so you may want to check it out for that reason alone. Is this a resounding investment? Yes, if you do want a nice quality and great features, you will find that this model does deliver on all of that.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> 4k camera, 28 minutes of flight time, 120 FPS mode</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> It can be too noisy at times</p><h4 id="3-Best-professional-drones-for-agriculture-DJI-Agras-MG-1-3"><a href="#3-Best-professional-drones-for-agriculture-DJI-Agras-MG-1-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

You need to make sure that you study the soil and field quality, not to mention you need to assess the health and irrigation of your crops. The DJI Agras MG-1 does a very good job here because its battery lasts for around 24 minutes. It’s a heavy drone at around 8.8 kg, but then again you do have a good and reliable drone that can be monitored and used in any way you want. The liquid tank capacity has around 10 liters and you can use it for spraying as well. They added a smart mode too and the motor is very good at managing battery power. It’s one of the best and most efficient drones out there for agricultural use and the experience you get from using it is very good.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> great features for agricultural use, suitable for spraying crops, great flight time duration</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive (Almost $15000), maneuverability can be better.</p><h4 id="4-Best-professional-drones-for-mapping-and-surveying-3DR-Site-Scan-3"><a href="#4-Best-professional-drones-for-mapping-and-surveying-3DR-Site-Scan-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

The price of around $12000 seems rather prohibitive, but the drone is particularly used for taking pictures and it does a very good job at that. It’s very stable and the camera comes with a stabilizer, so each one of the pictures works great and it manages to deliver an incredible value for your money because of that reason alone. You can use the captured images and footage to convert it into 3D models and contour maps if you want.</p><p> It works great for both enterprise and startup use, not to mention that its mapping features are great and to the point. You can charge it for around 1.5 hours, which is a pretty good time for a regular drone.</p><p> Also, you can outline the area that you want to survey on the map and the drone will fly itself. This is a nifty feature and one that many professional drones should start using sooner rather than later.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> You can outline the desired region and make it fly automatically, great image quality, stable and with a great performance.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong>  the price of around $12000 is rather high</p><h4 id="5-Best-drones-for-surveillance-Yuneec-Q500-Typhoon-3"><a href="#5-Best-drones-for-surveillance-Yuneec-Q500-Typhoon-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

It’s light at around 1.1kg, not to mention that it costs solely $800, so it’s not an expensive purchase either. Thanks to the 4K video and the 25 minutes of usage, you can easily capture great footage and use it without any problem in a wide variety of situations. The quality you receive is very good and the experience as a whole is a very distinct one. You should consider giving it a try because it does have all the best video capture features out there and it works really well.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> amazing video capture capabilities, great price, lightweight, durable battery</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> controls are a bit iffy at times</p><p> All these professional drones are great for a particular industry. If you really need this type of drone, you have to focus on each one of the individual industries and you have to focus on the value that it can deliver. Just consider checking these out and you will be rather impressed with the great experience you can receive in the end.</p><p><img                       lazyload

It costs less than $50 and it does have a flight time of around 8 minutes. It’s a very distinct drone and it has a powerful camera considering the price. You don’t have any smartphone controller, but then again you don’t have to register it with the FAA, and that can be very important to keep in mind. It’s an extraordinary drone and one that will impress you with its unique features and incredible size. Just consider giving it a shot if you want a quality drone for sale. Overall, at this price you will be more than ok with the features offered by the UDI U81A and it works really well too!

It’s certainly worth a shot, that’s for sure. It can face pretty powerful winds, but it’s not the fastest drone at around 18 m&#x2F;s.</p><h3 id="Best-FPV-racing-drone"><a href="#Best-FPV-racing-drone" class="headerlink" title="Best FPV racing drone"></a>Best FPV racing drone</h3><h4 id="Walkera-F210-Deluxe-https-www-amazon-com-gp-product-B01BBHYZEW-ref-as-5Fli-5Ftl-ie-UTF8-tag-vs-flora-20-camp-1789-creative-9325-linkCode-as2-creativeASIN-B01BBHYZEW-linkId-532bda8cedc733e0e49145f0c6bc754c"><a href="#Walkera-F210-Deluxe-https-www-amazon-com-gp-product-B01BBHYZEW-ref-as-5Fli-5Ftl-ie-UTF8-tag-vs-flora-20-camp-1789-creative-9325-linkCode-as2-creativeASIN-B01BBHYZEW-linkId-532bda8cedc733e0e49145f0c6bc754c" class="headerlink" title="[ Walkera F210 Deluxe ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BBHYZEW/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=vs-flora-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01BBHYZEW&amp;linkId=532bda8cedc733e0e49145f0c6bc754c"></a>[ <strong>Walkera F210 Deluxe</strong> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BBHYZEW/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=vs-flora-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01BBHYZEW&amp;linkId=532bda8cedc733e0e49145f0c6bc754c" >https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BBHYZEW/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=vs-flora-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01BBHYZEW&amp;linkId=532bda8cedc733e0e49145f0c6bc754c <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/walkera-f210.jpg" >walkera f210 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BBHYZEW/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01BBHYZEW&linkId=532bda8cedc733e0e49145f0c6bc754c" >https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BBHYZEW/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=vs-flora-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01BBHYZEW&amp;linkId=532bda8cedc733e0e49145f0c6bc754c <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br>)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BBHYZEW/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01BBHYZEW&linkId=532bda8cedc733e0e49145f0c6bc754c" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The Walkera F210 Deluxe is a very good FPV drone racing model.
