The goal of this group of technologies is to raise employee productivity. On-screen zooming and camera zooming for meetings are the two types of zoom functionality that Microsoft Teams users are most interested in. The user interface can be zoomed in since it is natively supported, however the camera cannot be zoomed in without the use of third-party software.</p><p>Unfortunately, Microsoft Teams does not provide native camera controls. A camera-controlling app with zoom-in&#x2F;zoom-out features would be necessary. You may try YouCam for that. YouCam Perfect’s new image-enhancing features enable you to create magazine-quality portraits from your selfies. The program comes in two versions, one of which is free and the other is a paid version.</p><p>YouCam is a program intended to control and use webcams. The webcam or any other camera that is linked to the computer may be accessed by this program, which is highly powerful. The free version comes with the basic zoom in&#x2F;out capabilities, but it also has sceneries, emoticons, and filters. Other unique features of the YouCam Perfect program include an immediate beautifier, a tool to improve skin tone, a physique enhancer, a collage builder, and a social network as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/youcam-zoom-camera.jpg"                      alt="youcam zoom camera"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075475/7443" target="_top" id="2075475">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075475" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075475/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Steps-to-Zoom-in-Teams-Using-YouCam"><a href="#Steps-to-Zoom-in-Teams-Using-YouCam" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Zoom in Teams Using YouCam:"></a><strong>Steps to Zoom in Teams Using YouCam:</strong></h3><p>The process to enabling CyberLink YouCam will vary depending on the sort of instant messaging program you are using. You may do the following steps to set up your camera to zoom in for an online meeting:</p><p>Step1The first step is to install YouCam on your computer. YouCam is available for both Windows and Mac. After installation, you may launch YouCam and provide it access to your laptop’s camera or Windows webcam.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/launch-youcam-application.jpg"                      alt="launch youcam application"                ></p><p>Step2In the next step, there is a narrow bar on the right side of the Settings screen, enable the Video zoom and afterwards, in the zooming bar, you can use it to zoom in and out with the help of the cursor as shown below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/enable-video-zoom-youcam.jpg"                      alt="enable video zoom youcam"                ></p><p>Step3You may enlarge the image as much as you wish before returning to the team’s tab or window. YouCam has to be synced with the teams after installation, so launch Microsoft Teams, click on your photo in the upper right, and choose settings as shown below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/click-profile-teams.jpg"                      alt="click profile teams"                ></p><p>Step4After visiting settings, you can click on devices and setup the Web camera. If you have completed the YouCam settings, there will be an option of YouCam, as shown below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/click-devices-microsoft-teams.jpg"                      alt="click devices microsoft teams"                ></p><p>Step5The camera will already be zoomed in or out, based on your choice, when you start the meeting.

Can you adjust camera settings in Teams?</h3><p>The camera cannot be zoomed in without using third-party software, however the user interface can since it is locally maintained by teams. There are no native camera controls in Microsoft Teams. YouCam is a choice in this case. Microsoft teams may partner with YouCam so they can access the zoomed video input. It can access the camera to zoom in or out to the appropriate amount. After that, YouCam is always an option if you want to change the settings.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134499/19576" target="_top" id="2134499">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134499" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134499/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-How-do-I-increase-screen-size-in-Microsoft-Teams"><a href="#2-How-do-I-increase-screen-size-in-Microsoft-Teams" class="headerlink" title="2.

Popular Text Effects"></a>Part 1. Popular Text Effects</h2><p>There are certain text effects that you generally come across whether you are watching movies, web series, and videos on social media or video streaming platforms. We have compiled a list of the most popular text effects that are extremely relevant in the current times in videography.</p><h3 id="1-Underwater-Text-Effect"><a href="#1-Underwater-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="1. Underwater Text Effect"></a>1. Underwater Text Effect</h3><p>Opening a video with the view of a beach and blue water is definitely stunning. But when you add an underwater text effect to display any title, it instantly grabs the attention of the viewers. In the underwater text effect, your text seems to be fixated or floating under the water. The text generally has a darker shade of blue over the light bluish water.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/under-water-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="under water text effect"                ></p><p>The text also has some distortion effect due to the waves in the water body so that it looks more realistic. There are different variations of that underwater text effect such as the text emerging out of water when there is a side view of the water body is taken. Another example of the variation is that text is floating over the water and having a watery gel or bubbly texture.</p><h3 id="2-Flame-Text-Effect"><a href="#2-Flame-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="2. Flame Text Effect"></a>2. Flame Text Effect</h3><p>Flame text effect is extremely common in the opening and closing credits of a video especially when it is an action video. Generally, a dark background is set against the fiery text so that the flame effect is more prominent and eye-catching. In fact, some video creators prefer a fiery background out of which the text with flame text effect emerges and make the required impact.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/flame-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="flame text effect"                ></p><p>There are different variations of the flame text effect available which make the effect relevant even today. Instead of the flame text effect spread outside of the text, the effect is contained within the text when the text is large enough to accommodate flames prominently within it. Sometimes, the text is distorted as if the fire is burning the text.</p><h3 id="3-Glitch-Text-Effect"><a href="#3-Glitch-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="3. Glitch Text Effect"></a>3. Glitch Text Effect</h3><p>Glitch text effect is an extremely popular effect in modern times where retro video effects are reaching a new high. The glitch text effect is designed to get the attention of the viewers instantly. In the glitch text effect, the text is divided into different sections and they are distorted or dispersed slightly as if your screen has a display issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/glitch-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="glitch text effect"                ></p><p>Glitch text effect is more prominent when it is applied to a large text having a light color against a dark background. The use of shadow and blur effect to get the desired glitch effect is common. More often than not, some short straight lines like strokes are placed around the text to enhance the glitch effect. Some creators prefer glitch text effect on 3D texts for a better visual appeal.</p><h3 id="4-3D-Text-Effect"><a href="#4-3D-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="4. 3D Text Effect"></a>4. 3D Text Effect</h3><p>3D text effect has been popular ever since its inception and its popularity has been steady in the videography world even today. Of course, with time, the effect has changed a lot to match the different niches of videos, and hence, you will come across a wide variety of 3D text effects. Starting from full screen texts and titles to adverts and promotional texts, 3D text effects find a place everywhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3d-text-video-effect.jpg"                      alt="3d text video effect"                ></p><p>Starting from 3D texts coming out of the background wall to 3D hologram text effect with retro look, you can apply any 3D effect to the texts and titles of your video as per relevancy. Most importantly, there is a wide scope for customization and personalization to captivate the viewers and get the message across clearly. You can go through 3D text After Effects tutorial and embed 3D texts in your video easily.</p><h3 id="5-Comic-Book-Text-Effect"><a href="#5-Comic-Book-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="5. Comic Book Text Effect"></a>5. Comic Book Text Effect</h3><p>Comic book text effect is an old-school style but its application in funny segments of a video is quite popular. Comic book typography has a superhero feel and it is mostly used while making the transition from one segment of a video to another. You will find several interview videos where the comic book text effect is used to show titles of different segments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/comic-book-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="comic book text effect"                ></p><p>Similarly, it is used for displaying texts and titles in anime videos. The text effect has a cartoonish look and a comic background to enhance the text effect. There could also be a blasting effect in the background that can act as a highlighter. The text color in the comic text effect also has a retro feel but bright in outlook.</p><h3 id="6-Blurry-Fade-on-Text-Effect"><a href="#6-Blurry-Fade-on-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="6. Blurry Fade on Text Effect"></a>6. Blurry Fade on Text Effect</h3><p>Blurry fade on is such a pleasing effect for the human eye especially when it is in animated form. The blurry fade on effect is like looking at a word with your specs on while the words in its surrounding come with blur effect. This text effect is widely used when there is a need to highlight certain words in a sentence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/blurry-fade-on-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="blurry fade on text effect"                ></p><p>In fact, the text effect is used to highlight a few characters in a word while the others remain blurred. You can also use the effect when you are making transitions between different texts and titles. It is more like an add-on to the usual fade on effect as it adds a blurring effect. It is important to get the attention of the viewers to specific texts.</p><h3 id="7-Type-on-Text-Effect"><a href="#7-Type-on-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="7. Type on Text Effect"></a>7. Type on Text Effect</h3><p>The type on text effect is also referred to as the typewriter effect.

BP350 is one of them with awesome music streaming facilities from USBs and CDs to any powerful wireless speakers.

The shimmery diamond effect type chassis is a true representation of the style. It consists of two solid black buttons for power control and eject option. Its disc try cover appears a bit wobbly when a disc is placed over it. Although, the webOS interface feature is not present in this LG product but a similar kind of smart platform is available. When you start BP350, a color-rich background appears on the home screen. Users can easily locate all the files over the server and they can be accessed via USB type connection. You will love the app offerings from this LG product, it is Now TV, BBC iPLayer, Netfix and Amazon Instant Video, whereas few rare ones are also present like Deezer, Spotify and Blinkbox. All apps are present on a tab that is labeled as ‘Premium’. As you hover over this tab, all the apps will pop up on the bottom so that you can access everything with ease.</p><p>Here is one more great news for BP350 buyers that LG AV remote 5 application is compatible with Android and iOS and it can be downloaded directly from stores get services like basic controller. It offers interactive user interface with highly responsive design like mobile apps. In simple words, we can say that BP350 contains everything that users need from a blu-ray player. Users can easily jump between CD tracks using numerical keys on this platform.</p><p>Many users feel disappointed to see that this Blu-ray player misses so useful output options. You will not be able to find optical digital audio, HDMI audio and coaxial audio outputs over here. However, the presence of USM port on the front side makes users eligible to watch movies directly from flash drive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bp350-1.jpg"                      alt=" "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148645/16836" target="_top" id="2148645">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148645" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148645/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h2><p>If we step ahead to talk about the performance of BP350 then, one can say that it is all in one pack, unless you are not searching for 3D. Users find its disc load times really good where they can easily reach up to the disc menu within 30 seconds; however, this performance greatly depends upon the BD-Live content amount present on Disc.</p><p>It is also possible to make picture alteration adjustments easily from ‘Options’ available below Info&#x2F;Menu on remote, you can access them at the time of disc playback. In this device, the default Standard picture mode can provide you all that you need as it leads to completely faithful representation for content inside disc. The cinema and vivid modes create an odd blend with luminance and colors but they can be avoided. If you switch to user mode, then everything is offered as per standard with a list of features like brightness and color, contrast, and picture controls, etc.</p><p>When we move ahead towards performance rating of built-in streaming service then it is also very impressive. You can easily get connected via BBC iPlayer, Amazon Instant and Netfix whereas everything is played on a well managed high-resolution content setting. If you want to access the YouTube app then this player can provide your 720p resolution but you will never miss the joy of quality viewing. It doesn’t follow frame rate detection procedures for streaming services.

Then you are ready to play Voice FX in the game.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Method-2-Use-a-voice-changer-app-on-a-PC"><a href="#Part-2-Method-2-Use-a-voice-changer-app-on-a-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Method 2: Use a voice changer app on a PC"></a>Part 2: Method 2: Use a voice changer app on a PC</h2><p>Are you prefer using a PC when playing PUBG? Surely, playing PUBG on your mobile is fun and it is also more simple, but there is a limit that you can’t do on your mobile. When you are gaming, the flexibility of the keyboard and mouse are the best things ever. Then, can you play PUBG mobile on your PC or laptop?</p><p>In this part, I will let you know how you play PUBG on a PC and how to connect with a PC voice changer. Tencent just launched its official PUBG Mobile emulator which enables you to play it even on a PC or a laptop. For those who want to have flexibility without limitation, you better watch the steps on how you play PUBG mobile on your PC below:</p><p>Step1 Download and install the Tencent Gaming Buddy emulator</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-6.jpg"                      alt="click download"                ></p><p>Download Tencent Buddy Emulator, then run the software and it will download the required files automatically. It takes about 10-15 minutes to install it.</p><p>Step2 Download the additional files</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-7.jpg"                      alt="download additional files"                ></p><p>When the emulator is installed, launch the game. It will download some necessary files required to launch the game. Make sure you have good internet connectivity since these files are large.</p><p>Step3 Get your chicken dinner</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-8.jpg"                      alt="you are done"                ></p><p>When finish downloading all the additional files, log in with your credentials to import all your mobile PUBG stats. All the controls are in a tab towards the right side of the screen, enter full-screen mode by pressing F11. Since PUBG servers detect emulators, you and your friends will only be paired with other players running this emulator.</p><p>Then, you may ask, “How do I connect with a PC voice changer?” No worries, I will let you know too. For your information, free voice changers are much easier to find on PC. There are some good voice changers for PUBG such as Clownfish, Voicemod, and MorphVOX. I will give you the steps to connect with Clownfish in PUBG:</p><p>Step1 Download and launch Clownfish</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-9.jpg"                      alt="set voice changer"                ></p><p>Download the software, then launch it. After that select “Set Voice Changer” and select any desired sound effects.</p><p>Step2 Click on “Hear Microphone”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-10.jpg"                      alt="hear the voice effects"                ></p><p>Click on “Hear Microphone” and hear the voice effects. Turn that off when you have chosen your favorite effect and you are done.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129739/7443" target="_top" id="2129739">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129739" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129739/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Method-3-Buy-a-hardware-voice-changer-to-connect-your-phone"><a href="#Part-3-Method-3-Buy-a-hardware-voice-changer-to-connect-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Method 3: Buy a hardware voice changer to connect your phone"></a>Part 3: Method 3: Buy a hardware voice changer to connect your phone</h2><p>After you know the voice changer on your phone and your PC for PUBG, what is another alternative you can do to change your voice in PUBG? Well, eventually you can also use a hardware voice changer and connect it to your phone. When you use hardware, the result should be in real-time, which is less than a 30ms delay, while it takes a longer delay when you use the software.</p><p>There are some hardware voice changers out there. For the hardware, I recommend you try TC Helicon VoiceLive Play. The TC Helicon VoiceLive Play is such a great vocal effects unit. It is simple, has a user-friendly layout, and has a small footprint. Around the LCD Display, there are six buttons. They are labeled and work dependent on context when you’re in the menus on the VoiceLive Play.</p><p>Their base functions are Genre, Setup, Effects, Favorite, Practice, and Mix (to adjust the output levels, USB input level, and the level for the in-built mic). These controls have context-dependent functions. To navigate the menus and adjust selected parameters, just simply use the left-right arrow buttons and the control dial below. There are also Back and Store buttons on either side of these. You use these to step back a menu level and save any changes that you’ve made.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-11.jpg"                      alt="voicelive play"                ></p><p>Compared to the VoiceLive 3 and the VoiceLive 3 Extreme’s menus, the 32-page guide to the VoiceLive Play tells you that the pedal is so simple to get to grips with. The menu system and layout of the VoiceLive Play make it easy to access any features that you want. There is a feature that will give you the tools you need to produce pretty much any vocal effect you want.</p><p>The effects groups include harmonies, reverbs, delays, transducers HardTune, doubling, harmony effects, and μmod, which is TC Helicon’s name for chorus, flangers, and similar effects. The sounds are generally good, too. For the price, the TC Helicon VoiceLive costs $ 279. Overall, once you finish setting up gotten your sounds, it’s really easy to incorporate the VoiceLive and you can have a hardware voice changer for PUBG.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972665/19272" target="_top" id="1972665">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972665" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972665/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-edit-the-voice-in-a-video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-edit-the-voice-in-a-video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to edit the voice in a video with Filmora?"></a>Part 4: How to edit the voice in a video with Filmora?</h2><p>Besides those mentioned above, do you know that you can also edit the video with Filmora?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Flash-Frame-Filmmaking-Script"><a href="#Flash-Frame-Filmmaking-Script" class="headerlink" title="Flash Frame Filmmaking Script"></a>Flash Frame Filmmaking Script</h2><p>Short films are becoming more and more popular with seasoned filmmakers, breakout filmmakers, and students alike. Search on YouTube and you’ll find thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of short film examples. But what makes for a good short <a class="link"   href="https://blog.celtx.com/write-the-script-5-basic-steps/" >film script <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? How can you make it stand out from the crowd?</p><p>Today, we look at seven important aspects of a great short film script and how you can improve yours. Can you put these into practice when writing your next script?</p><h2 id="Part-1-7-tips-for-improving-short-film-scripts"><a href="#Part-1-7-tips-for-improving-short-film-scripts" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. 7 tips for improving short film scripts"></a>Part 1. 7 tips for improving short film scripts</h2><p>There’s never been a better time to learn the craft of writing short film scripts. Interest and access to creating and viewing short films and series episodes have exploded worldwide, both on television and on the web. A great short film can also open doors for you into the film industry, as Barry Jenkins discovered with his great screenplay for the short film My Josephine, which I wrote in my screenwriting class at Florida State University.</p><p>But writing a successful short script is not easy. It requires the craft and concentration of a medieval artist carving scenes into walnut. So here are seven tips for creating a short script.</p><h3 id="1-Storyline"><a href="#1-Storyline" class="headerlink" title="1. Storyline"></a>1. Storyline</h3><p>This is always, always, the number one problem for my screenwriting students. They come up with big story ideas, often feature screenplay ideas, but quickly find that their idea doesn’t fit or work in short form. The result is what I call “narrative cramming.” The story can’t breathe. So, you need an idea that is small, specific, and significant to your main character.</p><p><strong><em>My Josephine</em></strong> was inspired by “an image of two people’s legs hanging over a table in my head,” according to Barry Jenkins. I saw them, young and intimate, working the night shift in a 24-hour laundry.” Even with this small, simple, and significant image as a starting point for a short script, Barry struggled to find a story in six pages that he could tell well. He attempted to include the murder in the Laundromat at one point, which resulted in, yes, narrative cramming. Barry rewrote the script a year later and “made it as simple as I could as a writer,” he told me. I was so moved by his transcript that I only wrote three words in the script – “Beautiful and gentle”. Just like his beautiful film.</p><h3 id="2-Characterization"><a href="#2-Characterization" class="headerlink" title="2. Characterization"></a>2. Characterization</h3><p>Writing compelling short scripts requires what Thornton Wilder called “shortcuts to the imagination.” And knowing what your main character wants in your story is the most important shortcut to understanding and discovering who your main character is. So, give your main character a desire or yearning for something that matters deeply to her. Then let your story flow from your character’s efforts to achieve that wish. The best stories, short or long, are about the human heart.</p><h3 id="3-An-independent-story"><a href="#3-An-independent-story" class="headerlink" title="3. An independent story"></a>3. An independent story</h3><p>It’s also a useful way to think of the script as an energy system, as William Gibson brilliantly says in Shakespeare’s play. An energy system begins with an Inciting Incident - a significant event&#x2F;discovery that unleashes the energy system - and ends with a Climax - the moment when the story’s outcome is known, and the energy system ends. Given the limited number of pages available in your short script, it’s essential that your inciting incident appears on the first page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/short-film-script-example-1.jpg"                      alt="an independent story"                ></p><h3 id="4-Conflict"><a href="#4-Conflict" class="headerlink" title="4. Conflict"></a>4. Conflict</h3><p>Conflict is every point of opposition between two forces (physical or intellectual), as well as the consequences of this opposition - all in full view of what can be seen on the screen, whether through cinema, television, or devices.</p><p>Screenwriters can’t convey conflict with background and inner thoughts or explanations of inner thoughts—that’s literary conflict.</p><p>Instead, screenwriters are tasked with presenting the conflict on screen through scene descriptions, character actions and reactions, and dialogue. While the dialogue is something we hear and could certainly—in smaller print—be used to replace literary prose to describe background information, backstory, and inner thoughts, the best screenplays and movies show rather than tell.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/short-film-script-example-2.jpg"                      alt="conflict"                ></p><h3 id="5-Turning-Point"><a href="#5-Turning-Point" class="headerlink" title="5. Turning Point"></a>5. Turning Point</h3><p>It’s helpful to think of a screenplay as a pattern of significant human change that you create at specific moments of change—the discoveries and decisions your main character makes that change the character and move the story forward. What your character wants and is trying to achieve in your short is the surface action – the events we see on screen. And how these events forever change a character’s inner landscape is deep action—your character arc.</p><p>If you want to see a well-crafted surface and deep action&#x2F;character arc in a fifteen-page script, read Chapter 17 <em>“Killer Kart”</em> in the book Making Short Scripts That Connect 5e, and screen the movie on the book’s website. It’s no surprise that the film is the most screened film ever made at the FSU Film School.</p><h3 id="6-Sublimation"><a href="#6-Sublimation" class="headerlink" title="6. Sublimation"></a>6. Sublimation</h3><p>Scenes are the <strong>“church of drama”</strong>, as William Gibson also brilliantly says. So, it’s helpful to think of your scenes as the time and place where a significant moment of change will occur, throwing your script into the next scene and moving your story forward. That is your purpose when you write a scene, to dramatize the moment (or moments) of change. That’s what matters. I like to think of a scene as an oyster and a moment of change as a pearl. Then cut to your scenes as close to the moment of change as possible and exit as soon as possible.</p><p>I got it, really got it, as a young playwright when the Actors Theater of Louisville commissioned me to write a ten-minute play. And I did—in six scenes that I hit late and left early, each with a small but significant moment of change that moved the story into the next scene. “A tender and effortless glissando that gracefully stretches from moment to wistful moment,” as The Los Angeles Times put it in my all-time favorite review.</p><h3 id="7-Ending"><a href="#7-Ending" class="headerlink" title="7. Ending"></a>7. Ending</h3><p>The end of a script is often more important than the 90 pages that preceded it. Because of the magnitude of its importance, many writers struggle to close their scripts with the right resolution. But don’t worry, we’ll show you everything you need to know about how to end a storyboard with examples of basic storyboard formats from Star Wars: <strong><em>The Force Awakens</em></strong> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/"><strong><em>The Big Short</em></strong></a>. We will discuss the technical aspects of writing THE END into scripts. By the end, you’ll have a good understanding of the formatting requirements for how to end the script.</p><p><strong>Example Script Defining Above Tips</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/short-film-script-example-3.jpg"                      alt="example script defining"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/352557/5172" target="_top" id="352557">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-352557" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/352557/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-edit-your-short-film"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-edit-your-short-film" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Given the limited number of pages available in your short script, it’s essential that your inciting incident appears on the first page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/short-film-script-example-1.jpg"                      alt="an independent story"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014849/22899" target="_top" id="2014849">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014849" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014849/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Conflict-1"><a href="#4-Conflict-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Conflict"></a>4. Conflict</h3><p>Conflict is every point of opposition between two forces (physical or intellectual), as well as the consequences of this opposition - all in full view of what can be seen on the screen, whether through cinema, television, or devices.</p><p>Screenwriters can’t convey conflict with background and inner thoughts or explanations of inner thoughts—that’s literary conflict.</p><p>Instead, screenwriters are tasked with presenting the conflict on screen through scene descriptions, character actions and reactions, and dialogue. While the dialogue is something we hear and could certainly—in smaller print—be used to replace literary prose to describe background information, backstory, and inner thoughts, the best screenplays and movies show rather than tell.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/short-film-script-example-2.jpg"                      alt="conflict"                ></p><h3 id="5-Turning-Point-1"><a href="#5-Turning-Point-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Turning Point"></a>5. Turning Point</h3><p>It’s helpful to think of a screenplay as a pattern of significant human change that you create at specific moments of change—the discoveries and decisions your main character makes that change the character and move the story forward. What your character wants and is trying to achieve in your short is the surface action – the events we see on screen. And how these events forever change a character’s inner landscape is deep action—your character arc.</p><p>If you want to see a well-crafted surface and deep action&#x2F;character arc in a fifteen-page script, read Chapter 17 <em>“Killer Kart”</em> in the book Making Short Scripts That Connect 5e, and screen the movie on the book’s website. It’s no surprise that the film is the most screened film ever made at the FSU Film School.</p><h3 id="6-Sublimation-1"><a href="#6-Sublimation-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Sublimation"></a>6. Sublimation</h3><p>Scenes are the <strong>“church of drama”</strong>, as William Gibson also brilliantly says. So, it’s helpful to think of your scenes as the time and place where a significant moment of change will occur, throwing your script into the next scene and moving your story forward. That is your purpose when you write a scene, to dramatize the moment (or moments) of change. That’s what matters. I like to think of a scene as an oyster and a moment of change as a pearl. Then cut to your scenes as close to the moment of change as possible and exit as soon as possible.</p><p>I got it, really got it, as a young playwright when the Actors Theater of Louisville commissioned me to write a ten-minute play. And I did—in six scenes that I hit late and left early, each with a small but significant moment of change that moved the story into the next scene. “A tender and effortless glissando that gracefully stretches from moment to wistful moment,” as The Los Angeles Times put it in my all-time favorite review.</p><h3 id="7-Ending-1"><a href="#7-Ending-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Ending"></a>7. Ending</h3><p>The end of a script is often more important than the 90 pages that preceded it. Because of the magnitude of its importance, many writers struggle to close their scripts with the right resolution. But don’t worry, we’ll show you everything you need to know about how to end a storyboard with examples of basic storyboard formats from Star Wars: <strong><em>The Force Awakens</em></strong> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/"><strong><em>The Big Short</em></strong></a>. We will discuss the technical aspects of writing THE END into scripts. By the end, you’ll have a good understanding of the formatting requirements for how to end the script.</p><p><strong>Example Script Defining Above Tips</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/short-film-script-example-3.jpg"                      alt="example script defining"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896560/19272" target="_top" id="1896560">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896560" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896560/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-edit-your-short-film-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-edit-your-short-film-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

That is about to change completely as Apple introduced the first Mac with a new <strong>Apple M1</strong> chip that uses ARM-64 bit architecture. It is Apple’s first custom silicon system on a chip that is being used in the new Macs. It was already being used in iPads and iPhones, and now it is being presented in the new MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and MacBook mini.</p><h2 id="What-does-the-M1-chip-mean-for-the-new-MacBook"><a href="#What-does-the-M1-chip-mean-for-the-new-MacBook" class="headerlink" title="What does the M1 chip mean for the new MacBook?"></a>What does the M1 chip mean for the new MacBook?</h2><p>The instruction set that is being used by the ARM technology is much more simplified than x86, thus, making it more energy-efficient. Up until today, Macs used Intel processors which had multiple chips for I&#x2F;O, processor, security, and memory. The M1 chip unlike the Intel processors has combined all these chips into a single system on chip or SoC. This makes it more simple, efficient, and better at performance.</p><p>M1 is also the first personal computer chip built with 5-nanometer process technology. Apple has managed to fit 16,000,000,000 transistors in a single M1 chip, which is more than any chip ever invented for personal computers.</p><ul><li><strong>CPU</strong></li></ul><p>The CPU consists of 8 cores with 4 of them being high-performance and four high-efficiency cores. These cores can work alone unless they are needed to do high-performance tasks, in which case all 8 cores can work together. This technology makes at least 3.9 times faster than its Intel counterpart and gives the MacBook an amazing 20-hour playback on battery time.</p><ul><li><strong>GPU</strong></li></ul><p>The GPU is an eight-core integrated chip with 2.6 teraflops of raw power output. The performance tests have revealed that running around 25,000 threads concurrently gives it a better performance than the GeForce GTX 1050 Ti.</p><p>Normally, PCs need a separate chip for graphics performance, but Apple’s new integrated GPU gives it a huge performance edge with minimum power consumption. According to apple, it is the world’s fastest integrated graphics in a PC.</p><ul><li><strong>Neural Engine</strong></li></ul><p>Apple’s latest neural engine has a 16-core design which enables it to execute 11 trillion operations per second.

The graphics are significantly better and all that with the minimum usage of power. Apple claims that the battery can last up to 20 hours.</p><p>According to a test between the new Apple Macbook with M1 chip vs Dell XPS 13 with 11th gen core-i7, the M1 performed way better than i7. The first test was opening 50 apps simultaneously which apple won by a huge margin. While the M1 chip was able to open and run all the apps within a matter of seconds, the Dell XPS took its time to open those apps and once it did, they were unable to run. Apart from all that, the M1 fan was working efficiently and silently while Dell had overheated and almost hanged.</p><p>When it came to testing the battery life, after 4 hours of intense gaming the Dell had a 7% battery left. The Macbook with M1 was still running at 30%. In benchmark performances, on single-core The M1 was 7% faster yet on multiple cores, the M1 was a whopping 63% faster than i7.</p><p>There is also a $300 price difference between the two with Apple Macbook being the cheaper one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/Intel-i7.png"                      alt="Intel i7"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1444782">                    <video width="1024" height="576" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1444782.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1444782">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1444782.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:640px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fpropmoneyinc.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1444782%2F14559'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1444782/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><strong>Apple M1 VS Intel Core-i9</strong></li></ul><p>When it comes to specifications the i9 takes a little of upper-hand in performance, but they also come in much more expensive PCs. Now even with all that, the most surprising aspect was that on Geekbench 5, the Apple M1 still outperformed the i9 on single-core by 23%; however, on multiple cores, the i9 was 19% faster than the new M1.</p><p>Keeping all that in mind, the M1 might still need to catch-up to the i9, but it certainly poses a huge threat for Intel as this is just Apple’s first experiment. One factor that also makes the i9 perform better is that it allows up to 128 GB of memory while the M1 only comes with 8 GB and 16 GB variants.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/Intel-i9.png"                      alt="Intel i9"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130869/7443" target="_top" id="2130869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettifr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2145079/17095" target="_top" id="2145079">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17095-2145079" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettifr.pxf.io/i/5597632/2145079/17095"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-about-the-Apple-computers-with-Intel-Chips"><a href="#What-about-the-Apple-computers-with-Intel-Chips" class="headerlink" title="What about the Apple computers with Intel Chips?"></a>What about the Apple computers with Intel Chips?</h2><p>The new M1 chip is only available in a limited number of systems as of now and Apple will still be making its PCs using the Intel chip.

As the globe becomes connected, new trends and fads emerge regularly. One of these developments is Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR), which has taken the world by storm in recent years. What began as a tiny community on sites such as YouTube has become a global sensation. Individuals of all ages (even celebrities!) are generating their own ASMR films on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and others.</p><p>But just what is ASMR? The experience differs from individual to individual, but the fundamental notion is the tingling feeling individuals get when exposed to specific noises such as whispering, tapping, and others. So <strong>why do people like ASMR</strong>? Read on to know.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/benefit-of-asmr-1.png"                      alt="benefits of asmr"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-do-People-like-ASMR"><a href="#Part-1-Why-do-People-like-ASMR" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why do People like ASMR?"></a>Part 1: Why do People like ASMR?</h2><p>Some individuals experience ASMR in response to various sensory “triggers.” It may be listening to someone talk or tapping or seeing someone brush their hair or folding their clothing with care and precision. It could also be particular noises like tapping or whispering. In addition, one of the most common triggers in ordinary life is a light touch, such as caressing someone’s arm or tracing one’s fingers on the back.</p><p>Here are some fundamental reasons <strong>why people like ASMR</strong>:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/benefit-of-asmr-2.png"                      alt="why people like asmr"                ></p><ul><li><strong>ASMR helps one cope with Stress &amp; Anxiety:</strong> Studies fund that ASMR assists people in dealing with stress and anxiety. One <a class="link"   href="https://asmruniversity.com/2018/06/26/asmr-research-survey-affect-physiology/" >2018 research <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> discovered that ASMR reduced stress, while another in 2017 discovered that 11% of individuals viewed ASMR videos mainly to assist them in coping with anxiety. Similarly, 2015 research found that 70% of its participants utilized ASMR films to cope with stress. It’s not just anecdotal evidence—research reveals that individuals who watch ASMR regularly report feeling happier and less stressed than those who don’t!</li><li><strong>It helps some people solve sleeping issues:</strong> If this is the case, you are not alone. Many individuals use ASMR as a sleep aid by many individuals. According to a <a class="link"   href="https://asmruniversity.com/2017/11/09/asmr-research-survey-personality-empathy-triggers/" >2017 study <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, 41% of individuals utilized ASMR to help them fall asleep. Another <a class="link"   href="https://asmruniversity.com/2015/04/04/peerj-peer-reviewed-research-asmr/" >2015 research <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> discovered that 82 percent of the subjects used ASMR to fall asleep because the videos are low-stress and calming. Because they generally center on relaxing sounds or sights, viewing ASMR videos might help you unwind after a busy day and prepare for the night.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Why-is-ASMR-Relaxing"><a href="#Part-2-Why-is-ASMR-Relaxing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why is ASMR Relaxing?"></a>Part 2: Why is ASMR Relaxing?</h2><p>Another pertinent query relating to the above section would be <strong>why ASMR is relaxing</strong>. Here is a detailed and factual answer.</p><p>ASMR is a sense of quiet, relaxation, and comfort from viewing particular videos that often show someone executing a delicate job, such as speaking or tapping on things. These films visibly improve people’s tranquillity and help them fall asleep quicker. They also establish a bond between the maker of the video and the viewer. You can trace this behavior back to ancient times when individuals would listen to others tell tales to feel comfortable and at peace.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/benefits-of-asmr-3.jpg"                      alt="why is asmr relaxing"                ></p><p>Giulia Poerio’s Hubbub public engagement work has included her <a class="link"   href="https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/28427/Bookshelf%5FNBK453230.pdf?sequence=1#page=123" >psychological research <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). The research stated that relaxing, tingling sensations begin at the top of the head and spread down the neck, spine, and sometimes throughout the rest of the body in response to specific triggers. According to this study, ASMR is fascinating, whether experienced or not. The sheer number of YouTube videos and accompanying viewership data show that it is far from a niche experience. According to anecdotal evidence, you can use ASMR as a sleep aid and a technique for increasing wellness.</p><p>People have even employed ASMR to assist them in curing their discomfort. While it requires further research to support this assertion, they conducted a study to keep it. In <a class="link"   href="https://asmruniversity.com/2015/04/04/peerj-peer-reviewed-research-asmr/" >2015, an analysis <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> indicated that 42 percent of individuals said ASMR helped them cope with chronic pain.</p><p>Scientists are still debating how ASMR can reduce chronic pain, although some relate it to the release of endorphins during an ASMR session. Endorphins are substances in the body that may make us happy and diminish our sense of pain. However, there is no authentication to support this idea.</p><p>Although they carried out a considerable study on ASMR and its impact on chronic pain, many individuals have found relief utilizing ASMR videos for their condition! If you suffer from chronic pain, try watching these ASMR videos for pleasure or to see if they help relieve your symptoms.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657396/16446" target="_top" id="1657396">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657396" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657396/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Is-ASMR-Good-For-You"><a href="#Part-3-Is-ASMR-Good-For-You" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Is ASMR Good For You?"></a>Part 3: Is ASMR Good For You?</h2><p>The study of ASMR is in its infancy at the moment.

That’s a great idea! Giveaways are a great way to engage with your fans and followers, and they can also help to promote your business. But before you start posting about your giveaway, there are a few things you need to keep in mind. Here are some tips for running a successful Facebook giveaway.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Choose-a-giveaway-prize-that-is-relevant-to-your-target-audience"><a href="#Part-1-Choose-a-giveaway-prize-that-is-relevant-to-your-target-audience" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Choose a giveaway prize that is relevant to your target audience</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/choose-giveaway-prize-for-facebook.jpg"                      alt="choose giveaway prize for facebook"                ></p><p>When it comes to choosing a giveaway prize, relevant is always the best way to go. First, consider your target audience. What would they be interested in? A coffee mug with your company logo may be great for some, but if you’re targeting outdoorsy types, they might prefer a hiking hat or water bottle.</p><p>Really think about what your target audience would find useful or fun, and choose a prize accordingly. It’ll make them more likely to enter the giveaway, and more likely to remember your brand down the line. Plus, it’ll show that you’re tuned into their interests - always a plus in the eyes of potential customers. So, when you’re planning your next giveaway, keep relevance front and center, and you’ll be sure to choose a winner.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Make-sure-the-giveaway-is-compliant-with-Facebook’s-rules"><a href="#Part-2-Make-sure-the-giveaway-is-compliant-with-Facebook’s-rules" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Otherwise, your giveaway could be shut down and you could be at risk of being banned from the platform. Here are a few things to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>You must use a third-party app to host your giveaway. Facebook does not allow giveaways to be hosted directly on its platform.</li><li>Your giveaway must have clearly defined rules. For example, you will need to specify how winners will be chosen and what the prize is.</li><li>You are responsible for ensuring that your giveaway is fair and legal. This means making sure that there is no purchase necessary to enter and that the prize is not illegal or restricted in any way.</li><li>Make sure you promote your giveaway in a way that complies with Facebook’s advertising policies. For example, you cannot include false or misleading information in your posts about the giveaway.</li></ul><p>Following these guidelines will help to ensure that your Facebook giveaway is successful and compliant with the platform’s rules.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886073/19272" target="_top" id="1886073">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886073" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886073/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Promote-your-giveaway-on-other-channels-such-as-your-website-and-email-list"><a href="#Part-3-Promote-your-giveaway-on-other-channels-such-as-your-website-and-email-list" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.
